<br />
Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, born 25 April 1903 in Tambov, Russia, die<br />
d 20 October 1987 in Moscow. He was perhaps the foremost contemporary So<br />
viet mathematician and counts as one of the great mathematicians of this<br />
 century. His many creative and fundamental contributions to a vast vari<br />
ety of mathematical fields are so wide-ranging that I cannot even attemp<br />
t to treat them either completely or in any detail. <br />
<br />
For now let me mention a non-exhaustive list of areas he enriched by his<br />
 fundamental research: The theory of trigonometric series, measure theor<br />
y, set theory, the theory of integration, constructive logic (intuitioni<br />
sm), topology, approximation theory, probability theory, the theory of r<br />
andom processes, information theory, mathematical statistics, dynamical <br />
systems, automata theory, theory of algorithms, mathematical linguistics<br />
, turbulence theory, celestial mechanics, differential equations, Hilber<br />
t&amp;#39;s 13th problem, ballistics, and applications of mathematics to problem<br />
s of biology, geology, and the crystallization of metals. <br />
<br />
In over 300 research papers, textbooks and monographs, Kolmogorov covere<br />
d almost every area of mathematics except number theory. In all of these<br />
 areas even his short contributions did not just study an isolated quest<br />
ion, but in contrast exposed fundamental insights and deep relations, an<br />
d started whole new fields of investigations. <br />
<br />
Apart from his penetrating work in Mathematics and the Sciences, he devo<br />
ted much of his time to improving the teaching of mathematics in seconda<br />
ry schools in the Soviet Union, and in providing special schools for the<br />
 mathematically gifted - which were very successful. Famous are also his<br />
 efforts to capture in quantitative form some aspects of Russian poetry,<br />
 especially that of Pushkin. It is told that ``it was fascinating to hea<br />
r him lecture on this, whether one understood Russian or not.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; In 1942 <br />
Kolmogorov married Anna Dmitriyevna Egorov. He did not have children of <br />
his own. <br />
<br />
Apart from being acknowledged without question in science, Kolmogorov wa<br />
s also blessed with social recognition. The USSR conferred to him seven <br />
orders of Lenin, the Order of the October Revolution, and also the high <br />
title of Hero of Socialist Labour; he gained Lenin prizes and State priz<br />
es. He occupies the first place among all Soviet mathematicians in the n<br />
umber of foreign academies and scientific societies that have elected hi<br />
m as member. These number over twenty, among them the Royal Netherlands <br />
Academy of Sciences (1963), the London Royal Society (1964), the USA Nat<br />
ional Society (1967), the Paris Academy of Sciences (1968), the Polish A<br />
cademy of Sciences, the Rumanian Academy of Sciences (1956), the German <br />
Academy of Sciences Leopoldina (1959), the American Academy of Sciences <br />
and Arts in Boston (1959). <br />
<br />
He was presented with honorary doctorates from the universities of Paris<br />
, Berlin, Warsaw, Stockholm, etc. He was elected a honorary member of th<br />
e Moscow, London, Indian, and Calcutta Mathematical Societies, of the Lo<br />
ndon Royal Statistical Society, the International Statistical Institute,<br />
 and the American Meteorological Society. In 1963 he was awarded the Int<br />
ernational Bolzano prize. <br />
<br />
Let me state here that I do not claim any personal relations with Kolmog<br />
orov. These remarks are based on second hand information, and primarily <br />
on sources in the Russian Mathematical Surveys, other references, and to<br />
 a much lesser extent on personal communications. My credentials for wri<br />
ting about Kolmogorov&amp;#39;s achievements are founded solely on my interests <br />
in that excellent notion we call ``Kolmogorov complexity&amp;#39;&amp;#39;. Since Kolmog<br />
orov was a man of many aspects, it is a pleasure to share some of these <br />
with the reader. This writeup was originally published as an obituary: P<br />
.M.B. Vitanyi, Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov, CWI Quarterly, 1(1988), pp<br />
. 3-18. See also references in Section 1.6 of M. Li and P.M.B. Vitányi,<br />
 An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and its Applications, Springer<br />
-Verlag, New York, 1993 (xx + 546 pp). (This is Section 1.13 in the Seco<br />
nd Edition of 1997.) <br />
<br />
Early Years: 1903-1933<br />
<br />
Kolmogorov was born on 25 April 1903 in the town of Tambov, where his mo<br />
ther Mariya Yakovlevna Kolmogorova had been delayed on her way from the <br />
Crimea. She died in childbed, and the responsibility to bring up the chi<br />
ld was taken over by her sister Vera Yakovlevna Kolmogorova, ``an indepe<br />
ndent woman who held high social ideals. She passed this over to her nep<br />
hew, raising him in the sense of responsibility, independence of opinion<br />
, intolerance towards idleness and poorly performed tasks, and the desir<br />
e to understand and not just to memorize.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; <br />
<br />
K. treated her as his mother until her death in 1950 at Komarovka (his d<br />
acha) at the age of 87. From his mother&amp;#39;s side K. was of aristocratic st<br />
ock, his grandfather Yakov Stephanovitch Kolmogorov was a district head <br />
of the nobles in Uglich. <br />
<br />
He spent his early years (before the revolution of 1917) at the family e<br />
state. The sources are less clear about his father. Apparently, K.&amp;#39;s fat<br />
her was the son of a clergyman, and was himself an agronomist with highl<br />
y specialized training, what they called at the time ``a learned agronom<br />
ist.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; <br />
<br />
K. started to work already at an early age (but presumably after the rev<br />
olution); and before he became a student at Moscow University, he worked<br />
 for some time as a railway conductor. He arrived at the University in a<br />
utumn 1920, with already a fair knowledge of mathematics, gleaned from a<br />
 book called ``New Ideas in Mathematics.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Students at the time received<br />
 grants that had little material value, but at the second course receive<br />
d, in addition, a ration of 16 kilos of baked bread and a kilo of fat. H<br />
ence, K. lost little time to check the minimum requirements for moving t<br />
o the second course (lecture attendance being noncompulsory). <br />
<br />
Conditions were generally harsh, and lecture rooms cold and unheated in <br />
the winter of 1920/1921. The following (unattributed) lines describe it:<br />
 <br />
<br />
``That grim year, nineteen twenty-one, <br />
<br />
the scientific march began <br />
<br />
Of Moscow University. <br />
<br />
Though I was not then very old, <br />
<br />
Though sheepskin coats enveloped me, <br />
<br />
I still recall that beastly cold.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; <br />
<br />
For some time K. was interested in Russian history as well as mathematic<br />
s. He did serious scientific research on XV-XVI century manuscripts conc<br />
erning agrarian relations in ancient Novgorod. In the twenties he made a<br />
 hypothesis on the way the upper Pinega was settled, and this conjecture<br />
 was later confirmed by an expedition to that area. <br />
<br />
In this early post-October revolution period the mathematical life in Mo<br />
scow was dominated by ``young Luzitania&amp;#39;&amp;#39; (1920-1923) and ``post-Luzitan<br />
ia&amp;#39;&amp;#39; (1923-1927), a nickname for the school of real function theory head<br />
ed by N.N. Luzin. This legendary personality apparently created either e<br />
nthusiastic admiration or, in their struggle for independence, one-sided<br />
 negation in his pupils. Among the first subjects in mathematics K. took<br />
 were set theory, projective geometry, and theory of analytic functions.<br />
 In 1921-1922 he obtained his first independent mathematical result (the<br />
 existence of Fourier-Lebesgue series with arbitrarily slowly decreasing<br />
 Fourier coefficients), and he became a pupil of N.N. Luzin. During this<br />
 time he was also approached by P.S. Urysohn, who tried to interest him <br />
in topological problems. Since K. had obtained some results on the descr<br />
iptive theory of functions, work that did not fit into Luzin&amp;#39;s plans, Ur<br />
ysohn brought him into contact with P.S. Alexandrov whose research inter<br />
ests were better related to this topic. However, at about this time K. c<br />
onstructed a Fourier series divergent everywhere, a result that attracte<br />
d international attention, and brought him for the time being in Luzin&amp;#39;s<br />
 orbit again. For this reason K.&amp;#39;s initial contacts with Aleksandrov sta<br />
yed very limited at the time. <br />
<br />
K. got interested in mathematical logic, and in 1925 published a paper i<br />
n Mathematicheskii Sbornik on the law of the excluded middle, which has <br />
been a continuous source for later work in mathematical logic. This was <br />
the first Soviet publication on mathematical logic containing (very subs<br />
tantial) new results, and the first systematic research in the world on <br />
intuitionistic logic. K. anticipated to a large extent A. Heyting &amp;#39;s for<br />
malization of intuitionistic reasoning, and made a more definite correla<br />
tion between classical and intuitionistic mathematics. K. defined an ope<br />
ration for `embedding&amp;#39; one logical theory in another. Using this - histo<br />
rically the first such operation, now called the `Kolmogorov operation&amp;#39; <br />
- to embed classical logic in intuitionistic logic, he proved that appli<br />
cation of the law of the excluded middle in itself cannot lead to a cont<br />
radiction. In 1932 K. published a second paper on intuitionistic logic, <br />
in which for the first time a semantics was proposed (for this logic), f<br />
ree from the philosophical aims of intuitionism. This paper made it poss<br />
ible to treat intuitionistic logic as constructive logic. <br />
<br />
His interest in probability theory originated in 1924. His first steps i<br />
n this area were performed jointly with A.Y. Khinchin. In 1928 he succee<br />
ded in finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the strong law of<br />
 large numbers to hold, and proved the law of the iterated logarithm for<br />
 sums of independent random variables, under very general conditions on <br />
the summands. In &amp;quot;A general theory of measure and the calculus of probab<br />
ilities&amp;quot;, 1929, he put forward a first draft of an axiom system for prob<br />
ability theory based on the theory of measure and the theory of function<br />
s of a real variable. Such a theory had been first suggested by E. Borel<br />
 in 1909, was further developed by Lomnicki in 1923, and received its so<br />
 successful final form with K.&amp;#39;s classic treatment of 1933. Much importa<br />
nt work on probability theory had already been done without benefit of f<br />
oundations, but this little book ``Foundations of the Calculus of Probab<br />
ilities,&amp;#39;&amp;#39; published in German in 1933, immediately became the definitiv<br />
e formulation of the subject. This determined not only a new stage in th<br />
e development of probability theory as a branch of mathematics, but also<br />
 gave the necessary basis for the creation of the theory of random proce<br />
sses - the subject of his 1931 paper below. It was here that the basic t<br />
heorems on infinite-dimensional distributions, now the logical foundatio<br />
ns for the rigorous construction of the theory of random functions and s<br />
equences of random variables, were first formulated. The involved ideas <br />
lie at the heart of the modern theory of random processes; they form ess<br />
ential concepts in the very idea of control theory, and play a vital rol<br />
e in K.&amp;#39;s later synthesis of information theory and ergodic theory. K.&amp;#39;s<br />
 many contributions in the theory of probability and statistics made him<br />
 generally acknowledged as the foremost representative of this disciplin<br />
e. <br />
<br />
In 1931 K.&amp;#39;s paper ``Analytical methods in probability theory&amp;#39;&amp;#39; appeared<br />
, in which he laid the foundations for the modern theory of Markov proce<br />
sses. According to Gnedenko: &amp;quot;In the history of probability theory it is<br />
 difficult to find other works that changed the established points of vi<br />
ew and basic trends in research work in such a decisive way. In fact, th<br />
is work could be considered as the beginning of a new stage in the devel<br />
opment of the whole theory&amp;quot;. <br />
<br />
The theory had a few forerunners: A.A. Markov, Poincaré and Bashelier, <br />
Fokker, Planck, Smolukhovski and Chapman. Their particular equations for<br />
 individual problems in physics, informally obtained, followed as specia<br />
l cases in K.&amp;#39;s theory. A long series of subsequent publications followe<br />
d, by K. and his followers, among which a paper by K. dealing with one o<br />
f the basic problems of mathematical statistics, where he introduces his<br />
 famous criterion (Kolmogorov&amp;#39;s test) for using the empirical distributi<br />
on function of observed random variables to test the validity of an hypo<br />
thesis about their true distribution. In general K.&amp;#39;s ideas on probabili<br />
ty and statistics have led to numerous theoretic developments, and to nu<br />
merous applications in present-day physical sciences. <br />
<br />
After graduation in 1925, K. stretched his stay at the University for fo<br />
ur more years as a research student, but finally in 1928-1929 stricter c<br />
ontrol on the number of years a student had for research was enforced. A<br />
n unprecedented number of 70 students finished in 1929, including K. Thi<br />
s raised the problem of where to continue his research. Aleksandrov was <br />
instrumental in securing for K. the single available vacancy in 1929 at <br />
the Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics of Moscow University, against<br />
 heavy competition. <br />
<br />
Youth: 1929-1940<br />
<br />
From 1930-1940 K. published more than sixty papers on probability theory<br />
, projective geometry, mathematical statistics, the theory of functions <br />
of a real variable, topology, mathematical logic, mathematical biology, <br />
philosophy and the history of mathematics. In 1931 K. was made professor<br />
 at Moscow University, and from 1937 held the chair of theory of probabi<br />
lity. From this time dates the life long friendship between K. and Aleks<br />
androv. Says Aleksandrov: ``in 1979 this friendship [with K.] celebrated<br />
 its fiftieth anniversary and over the whole of this half century there <br />
was not only never any breach in it, there was also never any quarrel, i<br />
n all this time there was never any misunderstanding between us on any q<br />
uestion, no matter how important for our lives and our philosophy; even <br />
when our opinions on one of these questions differed, we showed complete<br />
 understanding and sympathy for the views of each other.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; <br />
<br />
Says K.: ``for me these 53 years of close and indissoluble friendship we<br />
re the reason why all my life was on the whole full of happiness, and th<br />
e basis of that happiness was the unceasing thoughtfulness on the part o<br />
f Aleksandrov.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; <br />
<br />
K. describes how this friendship started in 1929 during a sailing trip o<br />
n the Volga. At that time, the ``Society for Proletarian Tourism and Exc<br />
ursions&amp;#39;&amp;#39; offered active vacations: one obtained a boat and camping equi<br />
pment at one city on the Volga which could be handed in at other cities <br />
downstream. K., already experienced in boating, decided to organize such<br />
 a trip, and asked (besides two others) Aleksandrov to join. The young m<br />
en bought the then popular ``Jungsturm&amp;#39;&amp;#39; suits for all of the crew. By w<br />
ay of books they took along only a steamboat timetable and a copy of the<br />
 Odyssey (and also manuscripts to work on and a folding writing desk). T<br />
hey started out at June 16, and covered 1300 kilometers before handing i<br />
n the boat at Samar downstream. K. and Aleksandrov then proceeded togeth<br />
er to the Caucasus by steamer. After some more wandering, they set up re<br />
sidence in an unused cell of a monastery on a small peninsula in Lake Sa<br />
van. Whiling their time away at secluded bays, in between swimming and s<br />
un bathing they also managed to get some work done: K. in the shadows on<br />
 integration theory and analytic description of Markov processes in cont<br />
inuous time, and Aleksandrov dressed only in dark glasses and white pana<br />
ma hat in the burning sun on his Topology book with Hopf. They stayed in<br />
 these idyllic surroundings for about three weeks, then set off partly o<br />
n foot, partly by other means of transport, and eventually climbed the A<br />
lagez mountain (4100m). They wound up at Tiflis, from where Aleksandrov <br />
proceeded alone to a prearranged appointment with a group of mathematici<br />
ans. K. continued hiking and mountain climbing. (By this time it was Aug<br />
ust.) Later, they joined up again at Gagra, on the Black Sea, and spent <br />
some more time there, sunbathing and swimming and doing mathematics. At <br />
about this time they decided to share a house together. <br />
<br />
After returning to Moscow they forthwith rented the first in a series of<br />
 houses in the nearby vacation village of Klyaz&amp;#39;m, and moved in together<br />
 with K.&amp;#39;s aunt Vera Yakovlevna. A short time later, Masha Barbanova, wh<br />
o had been K.&amp;#39;s nanny at the family estate near Jaroslavl&amp;#39; before the re<br />
volution, joined as housekeeper. In 1935 they acquired (initially part o<br />
f) an old manor house at Komarovka, with room for a large library and se<br />
veral guests. This `house at Komarovka&amp;#39; became a meeting place for mathe<br />
maticians. One of them said ``It is just like Oberwolfach (a mathematica<br />
l institute in the Black Forest), except that here Kolmogorov buys all t<br />
he drinks.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; <br />
<br />
It is perhaps instructive to see a glimpse of the mathematicians&amp;#39; countr<br />
y life: <br />
<br />
``As a rule,&amp;#39;&amp;#39; says K., ``of the seven days a week, four were spent in K<br />
omarovka, one of which was devoted entirely to physical recreation - ski<br />
ing, rowing, long excursions on foot (these long walks covered on averag<br />
e about 30 kilometers, rising to 50; on sunny March days we went out on <br />
skis wearing nothing but shorts, for as much as four hours on a stretch.<br />
 On the other days, morning exercise was compulsory, supplemented in the<br />
 winter by a 10 kilometer ski run ... Especially did we love swimming in<br />
 the river just as it began to melt ... I swam only short distances in i<br />
cy water but Aleksandrov swam much further. It was I however who skied n<br />
aked for considerably longer distances.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; As P. Halmos, visiting K. in M<br />
oscow in 1965 tells it: <br />
<br />
``Kolmogorov [had] five rooms [apartment in the University]. ... stacks <br />
of reprints in one corner, a collection of theatrical masks somewhere, a<br />
nd a couple of skis somewhere else. &amp;quot;Is this where you work? I asked. &amp;quot;N<br />
o, no&amp;quot;, he said: &amp;quot;I work out at the dacha; I am here only three days a w<br />
eek.&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; (At the celebration meeting of K&amp;#39;s seventieth birthday, a skiing<br />
 trip was organized where K. clad only in shorts outskied every other pa<br />
rticipant.) <br />
<br />
In 1930-1931 K. and Aleksandrov were mainly abroad. The year 1930 they s<br />
pent both at Gottingen. Here K. had contacts with R. Courant on limit th<br />
eorems, with H. Weyl on intuitionistic logic, and with E. Landau on func<br />
tion theory. K. relates the story that he solved a problem Landau much l<br />
iked to be solved, and wrote it up in detail. Landau being very pleased <br />
told everybody about the success and invited a paper on the subject, but<br />
, to his embarrassment, K. discovered a few weeks later exactly the same<br />
 result with the same proof by Besicovitch in Fundamenta Mathematicae. T<br />
he summer both K. and Aleksandrov visited Caratheodory at Munich (measur<br />
e theory), and were invited to stay with Frechet on the Mediterranean (t<br />
o work on probability theory in K.&amp;#39;s case). The journey there involved h<br />
iking through Bavaria, staying with Frechet for about a month, visiting <br />
P.S. Urysohn&amp;#39;s grave in Normandy, and continuing on to Paris. Aleksandro<br />
v left Paris by the end of September for Goettingen, and K. stayed on un<br />
til December, and had some meetings with Borel and P. Lévy, especially <br />
the last. While K. returned to Goettingen, Aleksandrov spent the spring <br />
1931 semester in the U.S.A. <br />
<br />
As another highlight of this period the article &amp;quot;Mathematics&amp;quot; for the se<br />
cond edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia is often mentioned. Anoth<br />
er area he turned to at the time was topology. Simultaneously with the U<br />
.S. topologist J.W. Alexander and independently of him, K. discovered th<br />
e notion of cohomology and founded the theory of cohomological operation<br />
s. The work of K. and his school on the deep connections between topolog<br />
y, the theory of ordinary differential equations, celestial mechanics an<br />
d the theory of dynamical systems, determined to a considerable extent i<br />
ts present state. <br />
<br />
At the end of the thirties, K.&amp;#39;s attention was drawn to the mechanics of<br />
 turbulence. In the hands of K. and his school the theory of turbulence <br />
obtained an accurate mathematical form as an applied chapter in the theo<br />
ry of measure of function spaces. With great physical intuition, in two <br />
short papers in 1941, K. posited in concise mathematical form ideas abou<br />
t the structure of the small-scale components of turbulent motion of flu<br />
ids and gasses, latent in earlier experimental work, particularly by G.I<br />
. Taylor. These hypotheses imply many qualitative results that are widel<br />
y applicable - what goes on, for instance, within the turbulence that oc<br />
curs in the wake of a jet aircraft. Some of the quantitative relations a<br />
rising have the character of new laws of nature - like K.&amp;#39;s law of &amp;quot;2/3&amp;quot;<br />
: in each developed turbulent flow the mean square difference of the vel<br />
ocities at two points is proportional to the 2/3rd power of their distan<br />
ce (if the distance is not too small or not too large). K. made also qua<br />
ntitative predictions on the basis of his theories, that were later conf<br />
irmed by experiments, e.g., the stratified structure of the ocean, an ef<br />
fect known as &amp;quot;pancakes&amp;quot;. K.&amp;#39;s 1941 contributions to the theory of turbu<br />
lence are perhaps the most important ones in the long and unfinished his<br />
tory of the theory of turbulence. <br />
<br />
Middle Years: 1940-1960<br />
<br />
He was interested in every branch of science, he and his pupils wrote ab<br />
out crystal growth, about geometry of the interaction of plants, and als<br />
o made significant contributions to ``birth and death&amp;#39;&amp;#39; processes and to<br />
 genetics. One of these papers brought him to a head-on confrontation wi<br />
th Lysenko. In a courageous stand in emphasizing scientific truth, in a <br />
paper published in 1940 in the &amp;quot;Genetics&amp;quot; section of Dokl. Akad. Nauk SS<br />
SR , K. showed that the material gathered by followers of Stalin&amp;#39;s prote<br />
g e Academician Lysenko, contrary to opinion, supported Mendel&amp;#39;s laws. A<br />
nother joint work (with Piscounov and Petrovsky) treated the rate of adv<br />
ance of an advantageous gene in a linear environment, (a topic studied i<br />
ndependently by R.A. Fisher, for whom K. had high regard). This was late<br />
r adapted to describe spreading of epidemics of innovations, and rumours<br />
. <br />
<br />
The theory of smoothing and prediction of stationary time-series is usua<br />
lly associated with the name of Norbert Wiener but in fact it was develo<br />
ped simultaneously by Wiener and K. during the second world war. <br />
<br />
In the post-war period K. turned again to turbulence, and made small imp<br />
rovements on laws he discovered before, that were experimentally verifie<br />
d as well. Topics in the vast range of classical mechanics, ergodic theo<br />
ry, function theory, information theory and the theory of algorithms bel<br />
ong to this period. He managed to find links between totally unconnected<br />
 fields, and published a small number of papers, but quite fundamental o<br />
nes, on each topic. In his work on dynamical systems one can distinguish<br />
 two periods. In 1953-1954 he made a seminal contribution to the fundame<br />
ntal problem of classical mechanics, identified fifty years earlier by H<br />
. Poincare in his study of the motion of planets around the sun. Neglect<br />
ing all but one planet one deals with an ``integrable&amp;#39;&amp;#39; problem that is <br />
well understood. However, the small effects associated with gravitationa<br />
l interaction between the planets introduces a profound qualitative chan<br />
ge related to the fact that the equations are now ``nonintegrable.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; In <br />
attacking this problem, K.&amp;#39;s great achievement was to develop a general <br />
theory of Hamiltonian systems under small perturbations, which has sever<br />
al practical applications, among others in the study of magnetic fields <br />
and plasma physics. This work also spawned, together with improvements o<br />
f K.&amp;#39;s pupil Arnol&amp;#39;d and by Moser, what is now known as the study of ``K<br />
AM-tori.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Subsequent computational studies aptly confirm K.&amp;#39;s insights <br />
and have opened up the enormously fruitful field of ``chaos in dynamical<br />
 systems,&amp;#39;&amp;#39; which is currently attracting much attention. These studies <br />
lead, for example, to better weather forecasting. <br />
<br />
At this time he also started to work on the theory of automata and the t<br />
heory of algorithms. Together with his pupil Uspenskii he formulated the<br />
 important notion of Kolmogorov-Uspenskii machine. He supported the up a<br />
nd coming field of cybernetics (theory of computation) against heavy ini<br />
tial antagonism (in the USSR). Many USSR computer scientists are K.&amp;#39;s pu<br />
pils or pupils of K.&amp;#39;s pupils. <br />
<br />
The second period from 1955-1959 consisted in applications from informat<br />
ion theory to the ergodic theory of dynamical systems. He introduced the<br />
 fruitful idea of informational (entropic) characteristics in the study <br />
of metric spaces and of dynamical systems. Together with Arnol&amp;#39;d, K. set<br />
tled in 1956-1957 Hilbert&amp;#39;s 13th problem, disproving the conjectured out<br />
come, by showing that a continuous function in any number of variables c<br />
an be represented as a composition of continuous functions of a single v<br />
ariable and addition. The ideas of introducing entropic characteristics <br />
in the theory of dynamical systems opened up a large new area. Another i<br />
mportant concept, that of a quasi-regular system (now called K-system), <br />
plays a very important role in the analysis of classical dynamic systems<br />
 with strong stochastic properties, such as in physics, biology and chem<br />
istry. In the years 1958-1959 K. applied ergodic theory to phenomena of <br />
the type of turbulence, which had a great influence on subsequent work. <br />
<br />
<br />
Later Years: 1960-1987<br />
<br />
While in previous years K. used concepts of information theory in mathem<br />
atical sciences, now it was the turn of information theory to be reconst<br />
ructed using the theory of algorithms, incidentally closing the circle o<br />
f his research by giving logico-algorithmic foundations to the theory of<br />
 probability. Algorithmic information theory, or &amp;quot; Kolmogorov complexity<br />
 theory&amp;quot;, originated with the discovery of universal descriptions of fin<br />
ite objects, and a recursively invariant approach to the concepts of com<br />
plexity of description, randomness and a priori probability. Historicall<br />
y, it is firmly rooted in R. von Mises&amp;#39; notion of random infinite sequen<br />
ces ( Kollektivs ), proposed from 1919 onwards as foundation for the the<br />
ory of probability in the spirit of a physical theory (according to the <br />
program outlined in D. Hilbert&amp;#39;s 6th problem), using the frequency inter<br />
pretation of probability. In 1940 A. Church proposed an algorithmic vers<br />
ion of von Mises random sequences, but the results were not yet satisfac<br />
tory. <br />
<br />
In his 1933 booklet K. had in some sense executed Hilbert&amp;#39;s suggestion i<br />
n his 6th problem: &amp;quot;To treat (in the same manner as geometry) by means o<br />
f axioms, those physical sciences in which mathematics plays an importan<br />
t part; in the first rank are the theory of probability ..&amp;quot;, in 1963 K. <br />
observes: &amp;quot;This theory [K&amp;#39;s 1933 set theoretic axiomatic approach] was s<br />
o successful, that the problem of finding the basis of real applications<br />
 of the results of the mathematical theory of probability became rather <br />
secondary to many investigators. ..[However] the basis for the applicabi<br />
lity of the results of the mathematical theory of probability to real &amp;#39;r<br />
andom&amp;#39; phenomena must depend in some form on the frequency concept of pr<br />
obability , the unavoidable nature of which has been established by von <br />
Mises in a spirited manner.&amp;quot; <br />
<br />
However, von Mises based his approach on axiomatically postulated infini<br />
te random sequences, representing repetitious independent trials with a <br />
limiting frequency. To this K. objects: &amp;quot;The frequency concept based on <br />
the notion of limiting frequency as the number of trials increases to in<br />
finity, does not contribute anything to substantiate the application of <br />
the results of probability theory to real practical problems where we al<br />
ways have to deal with a finite number of trials.&amp;quot; <br />
<br />
Following a four decades long controversy on von Mises&amp;#39; intended notion <br />
of an infinite random sequence, in a 1965 paper K. used the theory of al<br />
gorithms to describe the complexity of a finite object as the length of <br />
the smallest description (algorithm to reconstruct it). This would seem <br />
to make the definition depend on the algorithmic method used. However, i<br />
t turns out that there are optimal and universal methods for which the c<br />
omplexities of the objects described are asymptotically optimal. Althoug<br />
h there are many optimal methods, the corresponding complexities differ <br />
by no more than an additive constant. It is natural to call a finite obj<br />
ect random if it has no description of complexity less than it has itsel<br />
f. It is seductive to define an random infinite sequence as one of which<br />
 the growth of complexity if the initial segments with the length is suf<br />
ficiently fast, thus relating to von Mises&amp;#39; earlier approach. Due to una<br />
voidable oscillations of the complexity of prefixes as function of their<br />
 length this did not work out. However, P. Martin-Loef, a Swedish mathem<br />
atician visiting K. in Moscow in 1964-1965, was able to show that under <br />
appropriate axiomatic definitions of randomness, one can prove once and <br />
for all that the thus defined sequences satisfy all effective tests for <br />
randomness, and have measure one in the set of all such infinite sequenc<br />
es. This rigorously defined an appropriate class, intuitively satisfacto<br />
ry as well, to qualify as von Mises&amp;#39; Kollektivs. Later it was shown by L<br />
.A. Levin, P. Gacs and G.J. Chaitin that one can refine the notion of co<br />
mplexity by defining it relative to a set of admissible descriptions. If<br />
 admissible descriptions are restricted such that no description is a pr<br />
oper prefix of any other description, then an infinite sequence is Marti<br />
n-L of random if and only if each of its finite initial sequences has a <br />
complexity that equals (up to a fixed constant) its length. <br />
<br />
With the advent of electronic computers in the 1950&amp;#39;s, a new emphasis on<br />
 computer algorithms, and a maturing general recursive function theory, <br />
ideas tantamount to Kolmogorov complexity came to many people&amp;#39;s minds, b<br />
ecause ``when the time is ripe for certain things, these things appear i<br />
n different places in the manner of violets coming to light in early spr<br />
ing,&amp;#39;&amp;#39; in the phrase of Wolfgang Bolyai in another famous context. Thus,<br />
 R. Solomonoff in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had formulated the same idea<br />
s already in 1960. and had published his truly innovative work on the su<br />
bject already in 1964 in `Information adn Control&amp;#39;. <br />
<br />
According to Solomonoff his work got far more attention after K. started<br />
 to refer to it from 1968 onward, even though the attribution ``Kolmogor<br />
ov&amp;#39;&amp;#39; complexity seems to have stuck. Says K.: ``I came to similar conclu<br />
sions before becoming aware of Solomonoff&amp;#39;s work, in 1963-1964.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; <br />
<br />
Yet a third independent inventor entered slightly later, Gregory Chaitin<br />
 who was an 18 year old undergraduate in New York when he submitted a ve<br />
ry similar set of inventions for publication end 1965 for publication in<br />
 `J. Assoc. Comp. Mach.&amp;#39; (published in 1966 and 1969, the last paper con<br />
taining the definition of Kolmogorov complexity and results thereof, whi<br />
le the 1966 paper extends C.E. Shannon&amp;#39;s non-invariant notion of state-s<br />
ymbol measure for the complexity of Turing machines). Says Chaitin: ``th<br />
is definition [of Kolmogorov complexity] was independently proposed abou<br />
t 1965 by A.N. Kolmogorov and me ... Both Kolmogorov and I were then una<br />
ware of related proposals made in 1960 by Ray Solomonoff.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; <br />
<br />
One of the last papers of K. was on the topic of algorithmic information<br />
 theory - a paper together with Uspenskii published in 1987. For a compr<br />
ehensive introduction and a survey of the astonishing range of applicati<br />
ons of Kolmogorov complexity, see M. Li and P.M.B. Vitányi, An Introduc<br />
tion to Kolmogorov Complexity and its Applications, Springer-Verlag, New<br />
 York, 1993 (xx + 546 pp). <br />
<br />
As a Teacher<br />
<br />
K.&amp;#39;s pedagogical activities began in 1922, when he became teacher at the<br />
 experimental model school of the People&amp;#39;s Commissariat for Education. H<br />
e taught there until 1925. From 1925 till 1929 he was instructor at the <br />
University. Passing on knowledge and scientific ideas was very important<br />
 for K. His interests in this subject ranged over the full scale from ea<br />
rliest education to higher education, and occupied much of his time. He <br />
actively took part in organizing mathematical Olympiads in schools and g<br />
ave talks to school children. Thus he wrote a booklet on the topic ``Mat<br />
hematics as a Profession&amp;#39;&amp;#39;, which circulated in tens of thousands of cop<br />
ies. He put special emphasis on selection of mathematically gifted adole<br />
scents, since even the nonmathematicians will need such training in thei<br />
r later career <br />
<br />
According to K., by 14-15 years about half of the pupils have come to th<br />
e conclusion that mathematics and physics will be of little use to them.<br />
 In recognition of that fact a special simplified program should be foll<br />
owed by such pupils. ``The mechanically understood principles of uniform<br />
ity of schools providing general education, which excludes schools with <br />
a more detailed study of individual subjects, has outlived itself. As ap<br />
plied to mathematics it has already been destroyed by the creation of sc<br />
hools giving special training to computer operators and computer program<br />
mers.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; And: ``At 14-16 everything changes. At this age interest in math<br />
ematics usually becomes apparent, which quickly and painlessly leads the<br />
 student to concentrated work and then to the real research work of the <br />
young scientist (at 18-20 years). ... For the beginners, the young peopl<br />
e entering science for the first time, it is important to be convinced a<br />
s soon as possible that they are capable of doing something original, th<br />
eir very own. When offering a subject for research to a graduate or a re<br />
search student, the supervisor must not think only about the objective i<br />
mportance, or urgency of the subject, but also whether the work on the s<br />
ubject will stimulate the development of the young scientist, and whethe<br />
r it is within his powers to carry out, and at the same time demand the <br />
maximal effort of which he is capable.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; The ability to offer the studen<br />
ts exactly what is most important and ripe in the development of science<br />
, and avoid pursuing dead-ends, and what is at the same time in their po<br />
wers to accomplish is very characteristic for K. <br />
<br />
The number of Kolmogorov&amp;#39;s research students who have obtained their Ph.<br />
D. exceeds sixty. He was instrumental in substantial transformation (in <br />
the Soviet Union) of the very character of university education in mathe<br />
matics, in particular the organization of practical work in mathematics,<br />
 and updating the contents of mathematics. He also engaged in the search<br />
 for new contents of mathematics in secondary schools, the founding of m<br />
athematical boarding schools, gave cycles of lectures for teachers on th<br />
e structure of modern mathematics, and so on. Finally, he created an aut<br />
hor&amp;#39;s collective, and took part himself in writing textbooks on geometry<br />
, algebra and analysis for 6th through 10th grades. At the mathematical <br />
boarding school No. 18 at the University of Moscow, otherwise known as t<br />
he ``Kolmogorov school&amp;#39;&amp;#39;, he gave for years lessons up to 26 hours a wee<br />
k, and wrote accompanying syllabi. He also gave lectures to the students<br />
 on music, art and literature. He felt that intellectual development mus<br />
t be evenly balanced. The former pupils of this school are very successf<br />
ul and systematically take the first places in All-Union and Internation<br />
al Mathematical Olympiads. <br />
<br />
In 1964 K. became head of the mathematical section of a joint syllabus c<br />
ommittee of the USSR Academy of Sciences and that of Pedagogical Science<br />
s. K. also organized a Statistical Laboratory at the University of Mosco<br />
w, and succeeded in upgrading the budding library by obtaining large fun<br />
ds, and also international literature through partial use of money he re<br />
ceived as part of the international Bolzano prize. In 1972 on K.&amp;#39;s initi<br />
ative a compulsory course in mathematical logic was introduced for the f<br />
irst time in the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics at Moscow State<br />
 University. He wrote the syllabus (which was still followed in 1983) an<br />
d was the first to teach it. <br />
<br />
According to V.I. Arnol&amp;#39;d, ``K. never explained anything, just posed pro<br />
blems, and didn&amp;#39;t chew them over. He gave the student complete independe<br />
nce and never forced one to do anything, always waiting to hear from the<br />
 student something remarkable. He stood out from the other professors I <br />
met by his complete respect for the personality of the student. I rememb<br />
er only one case where he interfered with my work: in 1959 he asked me t<br />
o omit from the paper on self-maps of the circle the section on applicat<br />
ions to heartbeats, adding &amp;quot;That is not one of the classical problems on<br />
e ought to work on&amp;quot;. The application to the theory of heartbeats was pub<br />
lished by L. Glass 25 years later, while I had to concentrate my efforts<br />
 on the celestial-mechanical applications of the same theory.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; <br />
<br />
L.S. Pontryagin relates: ``Kolmogorov gave me an interesting task..: to <br />
study [some problems in] locally compact algebraic fields in which multi<br />
plication is not necessarily commutative... A week later I reported to A<br />
leksandrov that I had solved it in the case of commutative fields. Direc<br />
tly afterwards the three of us, Aleksandrov, Kolmogorov and I, met in Al<br />
eksandrov&amp;#39;s flat. With a shade of ironical doubt, Kolmogorov said: &amp;quot;Well<br />
 now, Lev Semenovich, I hear you have already solved my problem, let&amp;#39;s h<br />
ear you.&amp;quot; Kolmogorov declared my very first statement to be false, but I<br />
 immediately refuted him. Then he said: &amp;quot;Yes, it seems that the problem <br />
turned out to be much easier than I supposed.&amp;quot; None of the rest of my an<br />
swer aroused doubt. For the case of the noncommutative field the problem<br />
 was immeasurably more difficult. It took me a whole year to work it out<br />
.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; It is also said that K. was one of the very few non-political mathem<br />
aticians in the Soviet Union with yet real power. He quietly helped tale<br />
nted people with otherwise unfashionable views. <br />
<br />
K.&amp;#39;s pupils included in the early years: Millionshchikov (later Vice-Pre<br />
sident of the USSR Academy of Sciences), Mal&amp;#39;tsev, Nikol&amp;#39;skii, Gnedenko,<br />
 Gel&amp;#39;fand, Bavli and Verchenko. The subjects ranged from theoretical geo<br />
physics, mathematical logic, functional analysis, probability theory, fu<br />
nction theory. During and after the war: Shilov, Fage, Sevast&amp;#39;yanov, Sir<br />
azhdinov, Pinsker, Prikhorov, Barenblatt, Bol&amp;#39;shev, Dobrushin, Medvedev,<br />
 Mikhalevich, Uspenskii, Borovkov, Zolotarev, Alekseev, Belyaev, Mehhalk<br />
in, Epokhin, Rozanov, Sinai, Tikhomirov, Shiryaev, Arnol&amp;#39;d, Bassalygo, a<br />
nd Ofman. Later also Prokhorov, L.A. Levin, Kozlov, Zhurbenko, Abramov, <br />
and Bulinskii. His pupils include a number of well-known foreign mathema<br />
ticians, among who the Swede P. Martin-L of. Pupils who became member of<br />
 the USSR Academy of Sciences: A.I. Mal&amp;#39;tsev (algebra, mathematical logi<br />
c), S.M. Nikol&amp;#39;skii (function theory), A.M. Obukhov (physics of the atmo<br />
sphere), I.M. Gel&amp;#39;fand (functional analysis), Yu.V. Prokhorov (probabili<br />

. Monin (oceanology), and V.I. Arnol&amp;#39;d. The Ukrainian Academy of Science<br />
s: B.V. Gnedenko (probability theory, history of mathematics), V.M. Mikh<br />
alevich (cybernetics), etc. <br />
<br />
Scientific Career<br />
<br />
K. entered Moscow University in 1920, graduated in 1925, and got his (eq<br />
uivalent of) Ph.D. in 1929, when he also got a position on the faculty. <br />
In 1931 K. became professor at Moscow University, and from 1933-1939 he <br />
also became Director of the Scientific Research Institute of Mathematics<br />
 at the Moscow State University. Apparently, he was involved with the sc<br />
ientific research of all graduate students at the institute, not only hi<br />
s own. Most of them mention the unforgettable hikes on Sundays when K. i<br />
nvited all his own students (graduates and undergraduates) as well as st<br />
udents from other supervisors. These 40 km walks in the environment of B<br />
olshevo, Klyaz&amp;#39;m, later Komarovka, are remembered as intellectually stim<br />
ulating and culturally wide ranging experiences, ending when he and Alek<br />
sandrov treated the whole company to dinner in their dacha. In 1939 K. w<br />
as elected as an Academician of the All-Union Academy of Sciences and as<br />
 Academician-Secretary of the Physics-Mathematical Section. He also did <br />
enormous work as head of the mathematics editorial board of the Publishi<br />
ng House of Foreign Literature and as editor of the mathematics section <br />
of the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia. During the second world war K. engage<br />
d in the war effort by solving problems in ballistics and began research<br />
 on problems of quality control of mass industrial production. From 1964<br />
 to 1966, and from 1976 till at least 1983 K. has been President of the <br />
Moscow Mathematical Society; from 1946 to 1954 and from 1983 on Editor-i<br />
n-chief of Uspekhi Math. Nauk (Russian Mathematical Surveys). At the Uni<br />
versity of Moscow, K. held from 1938 to 1966 the chair of probability th<br />
eory. From 1966 till 1976 he was the head of the Interdepartmental Labor<br />
atory of Statistical Methods, and from 1976 to 1980 he held the chair of<br />
 mathematical statistics, which he organized. From 1980 on K. held the c<br />
hair of mathematical logic. From 1951 to 1953 he was Director of the Ins<br />
titute of Mathematics and Mechanics of the Moscow State University; from<br />
 1954 to 1956 and from 1978 to at least 1983 the head of the mathematics<br />
 section of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics. From 1954 to 1958 <br />
he was Dean of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of the Universit<br />
