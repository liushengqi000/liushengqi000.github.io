Reading Comprehension&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
In this tutorial, we&amp;#39;ll go through how to approach and answer reading comprehension questions. Whereas Sentence Completion questions require you to figure out how a string of words work together to form one idea, Reading Comprehension questions ask you to understand the way that a great number of words work together to form a series of integrated ideas.In this section, you&amp;#39;ll be given a fairly long passage and will have to determine what goes on in it. We&amp;#39;ll help you get at the most basic level of what happened in the text, as well as figure out what the text means, what it does and does not say, and how all its parts - words, sentences, paragraphs - fit together. A series of questions after the passage will test how well you&amp;#39;ve understood what you&amp;#39;ve read, to see whether you&amp;#39;ve been able to synthesize and integrate the ideas presented in the passage. The reading comprehension introduction is divided into three sections: Walk through a typical reading passageLearn what questions look likeTips on answering the reading comprehension questions You can jump between these sections with drop down menu below, or just work through them in order...The Structure of a Reading Passage&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
To best understand the passages, we recommend developing a habit of reading actively. We often ask our students to read a passage aloud. If we hear them drone from one sentence to the next, we know that they&amp;#39;re reading indifferently. They haven&amp;#39;t caught the tone and flow of the passage. It is crucial that you integrate and synthesize the passage as you go through it. You can&amp;#39;t be passive in your reading: it&amp;#39;s not enough just to let your eyes move from word to word. Think about what you read.Reading actively means absorbing the text as you make your way through it. When we have students read aloud, we stop them after each paragraph and ask them to say, in one sentence, what the point of that paragraph was. Stopping and synthesizing will help you see the shape that the text as a whole is taking. Starting on the next page, we&amp;#39;ll examine a sample reading passage in depth...Take a few minutes to read through the following passage: This passage presents an Australian biologist&amp;#39;s unique solution to the problem of dwindling numbers of native Australian animals. The Australian continent, surrounded by ocean on all sides and distant from other land masses, is home to a vast array of native animals not to be found anywhere else on earth. Since the Europeans arrived in Australia, however, native species have been disappearing at a rate not seen since the mass extinctions brought about 65 million years ago when a huge meteorite crashed off the coast of what is now Mexico. Dissatisfied with traditional efforts at conservation, biologist Michael Archer, director of the Australian Museum in Sydney, has begun to champion a new method for ensuring the perpetuation of Australia&amp;#39;s endangered species. Archer advocates domesticating native animals such as the quoll, the hopping mouse, the wallaby, the sugar glider and the brushtail phascogale. The Australian government has reservations about the wisdom of keeping native animals as pets; in no state are rare or endangered animals like quolls or bilbies permitted to be kept as pets. And the idea has been denounced by animal rights groups, who assert that domestication is tantamount to abuse. Archer asserts that animals kept in a home can lead full, happy, and active lives. Having shared his two-bedroom apartment with a quoll - a cat-sized marsupial - for a number of years, he considers himself qualified to proclaim these animals to be ideal house pets. His own, he affirms, was the most wonderful animal he&amp;#39;d ever interacted with: clean as a cat, as bright and playful as a puppy, fun and friendly, able to bond closely with humans. More than this, however, Archer insists that turning these animals into pets may be the only means of ensuring their survival. He is convinced that once others discover the animals&amp;#39; charming traits and begin to recognize the merits of Australia&amp;#39;s native species, their fate will be less precarious. He notes that no animal domesticated by humans has ever died out. The more familiar with an animal people are, the more concerned for its welfare they become. The idea of turning wild animals into pets is only half of Archer&amp;#39;s vision for restoring Australia&amp;#39;s endangered species. He also insists that the continent be rid of pets introduced by the Europeans. Besides detracting attention from local species, cats in particular do tremendous damage to the environment, killing large quantities of native animals each day. Because they don&amp;#39;t depend on these native animals for sustenance - because they are attracted by the hunt and not by a need for food - cats and dogs tend to overkill. Furthermore, cats transmit toxoplasmosis, a disease that kills marsupials, making them a double danger to their adoptive land. How does this passage work? Let&amp;#39;s go through it paragraph by paragraph...In the first paragraph, the author asserts a problem: The Australian continent, surrounded by ocean on all sides and distant from other land masses, is home to a vast array of native animals not to be found anywhere else on earth. Since the Europeans arrived in Australia, however, native species have been disappearing at a rate not seen since the mass extinctions brought about 65 million years ago when a huge meteorite crashed off the coast of what is now Mexico. What is that problem? Many animals that are native to - and found only in - Australia are dying off.From what you know of the way an essay works, you probably expect a proposed solution to follow the introduction of a problem. This is a perfectly reasonable and logical expectation, and in this case, your supposition is rewarded: Dissatisfied with traditional efforts at conservation, biologist Michael Archer, director of the Australian Museum in Sydney, has begun to champion a new method for ensuring the perpetuation of Australia&amp;#39;s endangered species. Archer advocates domesticating native animals such as the quoll, the hopping mouse, the wallaby, the sugar glider and the brushtail phascogale. What&amp;#39;s the solution? According to one man - a Michael Archer - endangered species should be kept as pets.The next paragraph lets us know that Archer&amp;#39;s unconventional views are controversial. At least two groups oppose his proposal. The Australian government has reservations about the wisdom of keeping native animals as pets; in no state are rare or endangered animals like quolls or bilbies permitted to be kept as pets. And the idea has been denounced by animal rights groups, who assert that domestication is tantamount to abuse. The government prohibits keeping endangered species as pets; animals rights groups protest the idea.The next paragraph refutes the objection raised in the preceding passage: Archer asserts that animals kept in a home can lead full, happy, and active lives. Having shared his two-bedroom apartment with a quoll - a cat-sized marsupial - for a number of years, he considers himself qualified to proclaim these animals to be ideal house pets. His own, he affirms, was the most wonderful animal he&amp;#39;d ever interacted with: clean as a cat, as bright and playful as a puppy, fun and friendly, able to bond closely with humans. Contrary to what his detractors say, Archer insists that animals raised as pets fare well.After making this refutation, the passage goes one step further and explains why it is imperative that the proposed action be taken: More than this, however, Archer insists that turning these animals into pets may be the only means of ensuring their survival. He is convinced that once others discover the animals&amp;#39; charming traits and begin to recognize the merits of Australia&amp;#39;s native species, their fate will be less precarious. He notes that no animal domesticated by humans has ever died out. The more familiar with an animal people are, the more concerned for its welfare they become. In the final paragraph, the level of argumentation is deepened. The author introduces another, parallel proposal to solve the problem of Australia&amp;#39;s endangered animals. The idea of turning wild animals into pets is only half of Archer&amp;#39;s vision for restoring Australia&amp;#39;s endangered species. He also insists that the continent be rid of pets introduced by the Europeans. Besides detracting attention from local species, cats in particular do tremendous damage to the environment, killing large quantities of native animals each day. Because they don&amp;#39;t depend on these native animals for sustenance - because they are attracted by the hunt and not by a need for food - cats and dogs tend to overkill. Furthermore, cats transmit toxoplasmosis, a disease that kills marsupials, making them a double danger to their adoptive land. In an effort to save the endangered native species, damaging foreign species need to be eradicated.So, the passage works like this: 1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Introduction of a problem 2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Proposed solution 3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Objections to proposed solution 4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Refutation of objections 5.&nbsp; &nbsp; Reassertion of workability of proposed solution 6.&nbsp; &nbsp; Presentation of second layer of proposed solution In this short reading passage, as in all of them, every paragraph has a purpose and function in the whole. Here is a popup window containing the passage, for future reference.Reading Passage Questions&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
On a test, a series of questions would follow this passage. They would ask you about the following things: ·&nbsp; &nbsp; What is the main idea of the passage? ·&nbsp; &nbsp; What are some of the specific points the author brings up in order to forward the main idea? ·&nbsp; &nbsp; What can we infer from the passage? That is, what ideas can we take away from it that the author hasn&amp;#39;t explicitly said? ·&nbsp; &nbsp; What does the author think about the topic? Does she agree with the information she&amp;#39;s presented? Is her tone affirming or detracting? ·&nbsp; &nbsp; What stylistic techniques or specific vocabulary does the author use in her description? Let&amp;#39;s look at each of these question types in more detail.What is the main idea of the passage?You&amp;#39;ll find this question type phrased in a number of ways. Some of the kinds of things you&amp;#39;ll see are: ·&nbsp; &nbsp; The central idea of the passage is... ·&nbsp; &nbsp; The author&amp;#39;s primary point is... ·&nbsp; &nbsp; The author&amp;#39;s chief concern is... and so forth. Occasionally, the question will be couched in different terms. The alternative form usually looks something like this: ·&nbsp; &nbsp; What would the most appropriate title for this passage be? No matter what words they use to ask this question, what you need to discern here is the main point of the passage.What is the main argument of this passage?Look through the passage again if you need to, (here&amp;#39;s another link to the passage) and then consider the following answers:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Native Australian animals make better pets than European pets like cats and dogs.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Native Australian animals make better pets for Australians than European pets like cats and dogs.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adopting rare native Australian animals as house pets will ensure that these endangered species do not die out.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cats do more harm than good in Australia.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The native Australian quoll makes an ideal house pet.<br />
Which one do you think is right? Let&amp;#39;s go through each of them to show what&amp;#39;s right or wrong about them.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Native Australian animals make better pets than European pets like cats and dogs.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we could reasonably assume that Michael Archer would agree with a statement like this, nowhere in the passage is this claim made.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Native Australian animals make better pets for Australians than European pets like cats and dogs.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer is closer than (A). Archer isn&amp;#39;t concerned with pets in general, but with Australian pets and pets for Australians. In the end, though, he&amp;#39;s not making a comparison between European and Australian pets. Instead, he&amp;#39;s upholding the importance of domesticating Australian animals.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adopting rare native Australian animals as house pets will ensure that these endangered species do not die out.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the right answer. It summarizes the whole of Archer&amp;#39;s argument in one sentence.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cats do more harm than good in Australia.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might pick this answer because it was the last thing you read about before you got to the questions. And certainly, the passage does make this point. But it is not the primary argument or main idea of the passage.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The native Australian quoll makes an ideal house pet.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with (D), the passage does tell us this, or something very close to it. But you need to ask yourself: Is this the primary argument or main idea of the passage? No. It&amp;#39;s a fact or opinion that supports the primary argument.<br />
So, how do you get at the main point of the passage? Think like an investigative journalist as you read through the passage. Keeping four of the five W&amp;#39;s in mind as you read will help: Who&nbsp; &nbsp; (or what) is this passage treating? What&amp;#39;s the dominant theme?<br />
What&nbsp; &nbsp; problem is presented in the passage? What solutions are given for it?<br />
Where&nbsp; &nbsp; do we see specific examples of the problem? What kind of details does the author offer to illustrate her point?<br />
When&nbsp; &nbsp; is the author making this point?<br />
One other sure way to narrow in on it is to re-read the first and last sentences of each paragraph. This will give you not only a sense of the flow of the passage, but it should also help you zero in on the main points. Now that you&amp;#39;ve got a sense of the things you should be looking for as you read and as you answer the main idea type of question, let&amp;#39;s move on to other questions you might see.What specific points does the author bring up to forward the main idea?Whereas in the first question type, you had to show you had a sense of the overall workings of the passage, here you&amp;#39;re being asked to focus in on the details that make up the whole. There are a number of ways you might be asked to show your understanding of specific details: ·&nbsp; &nbsp; Which of the following arguments does NOT appear in the passage... ·&nbsp; &nbsp; The passage supports which of the following claims... ·&nbsp; &nbsp; The author raises X example in order to.... ·&nbsp; &nbsp; The example given in the passage is most analogous to... ·&nbsp; &nbsp; Which of the following arguments would most strengthen example X.... and so on.Let&amp;#39;s look back at our passage and at a specifics or detail-oriented question that could follow it. If you need to scan the passage again, here&amp;#39;s another copy. When you&amp;#39;re ready, read through the question and the possible answers: According to the passage above, all of the following factors contribute to the decline of native Australian species EXCEPT:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The proliferation of predatory cats brought over by the Europeans.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmission of toxoplasmosis to marsupials.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human indifference to the fate of native species.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destruction by pollution and urban expansion of native species&amp;#39; natural habitats.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government-imposed restrictions prohibiting the ownership of endangered species.<br />
Which one do you think is right? Let&amp;#39;s go through the passage and see where we find each of the points above.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proliferation of predatory cats brought over by the Europeans.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point is articulated as: cats in particular do tremendous damage to the environment, killing large quantities of native animals each day.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmission of toxoplasmosis to marsupials.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see this in the passage as: cats transmit toxoplasmosis, a disease that kills marsupials.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human indifference to the fate of native species.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author makes this point when she writes: no animal domesticated by humans has ever died out. The more familiar with an animal people are, the more concerned for its welfare they become.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destruction by pollution and urban expansion of native species&amp;#39; natural habitats.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the right answer - the one fact that isn&amp;#39;t supported by the passage. You may have been tempted to think this information was in the passage, mostly because it&amp;#39;s information that lines up with what you know to be true. This is a major thing to watch out for in reading comprehension questions: make sure particulars are explicitly stated in the passage, and not just well-known facts or widely-held opinions.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government-imposed restrictions prohibiting the ownership of endangered species.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this one you need to do a bit of work on your own. The passage tells us that: The Australian government has reservations about the wisdom of keeping native animals as pets; in no state are rare or endangered animals like quolls or bilbies permitted to be kept as pets. You need to take this information and infer a consequence from it: If people can&amp;#39;t harbor these endangered animals, their likelihood of survival decreases.<br />
Here are some tips about specifics or detailed-oriented types of questions: Once you&amp;#39;ve read the question, 1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Scan through the passage and locate the area where this particular topic is discussed. Then re-read the pertinent part of the passage, keeping the specifics of the question in mind. 2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Always be sure that the answer you&amp;#39;ve chosen appears in the text. Don&amp;#39;t be fooled by the appearance of widely held opinions or commonly held beliefs. Now let&amp;#39;s move on to the next type of question.Nearly every reading comprehension passage will have a question asking you about ideas that aren&amp;#39;t explicitly stated in the text. In these cases, you need to make inferences based on information you&amp;#39;ve been given, and you need to take that information and go beyond what the text states overtly. This type of question is most frequently phrased as: ·&nbsp; &nbsp; We can infer which of the following from the passage? ·&nbsp; &nbsp; The author would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements? This category could also include questions that go outside the passage, such as: ·&nbsp; &nbsp; What audience is the author most likely addressing? ·&nbsp; &nbsp; What other claims could be supported by this argument? Let&amp;#39;s have a look at an example...Remember our passage. (Click here to pop up a window containing it) Michael Archer would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Because of their smell, cat litter boxes are unpleasant to have in one&amp;#39;s home.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If cats are not declawed, they will do significant damage to one&amp;#39;s furniture.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of Europeans in Australia marked a serious downturn for Australian culture.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Australian animals would have done far less damage to the European environment than cats have done to the Australian landscape.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans are responsible for reversing the harm they have done to the environment.<br />
Let&amp;#39;s think about the kinds of things we can and cannot gather from the information we have. We know Archer doesn&amp;#39;t like cats especially - or at least not cats in Australia - and so we might be tempted to choose (A) or (B), or possibly even (D). However, with regard to (A) or (B), there is nothing in the passage that enables us to suppose either of these things. If you recall that he is actually advocating harboring small wild animals in one&amp;#39;s home, you might reasonably assume that he might not be concerned with either odors or furniture damage. As to (D), we don&amp;#39;t know how Australian species would have fared in Europe; we might actually infer that he would have opposed importing them because he is concerned with maintaining the landscape as it is. So this doesn&amp;#39;t make for a particularly viable answer. Let&amp;#39;s look at the remaining two...We might suspect that Archer has little love for the Europeans, but all we know for certain is that he disapproves of the pets they brought with them. We can&amp;#39;t reasonably infer any opinion he might hold about the culture they imported, and whether - and to what end - it displaced that of the locals. Which leaves us with (E). It&amp;#39;s the right answer not only because we eliminated the rest, but because it stands on its own. He is concerned with the environment, is censorious of the damage humans have done to their environment, and calls for a reversal of this process - all in his insisting that the continent be rid of pets introduced by the Europeans. Now for some general thoughts about these types of question...As you do questions based on inference, make sure you look at what the passage doesn&amp;#39;t say. If they give you an answer that is drawn directly from the passage, it&amp;#39;s wrong. You need to infer - to draw a conclusion about the facts that are given, not just restate them. Not only should you knock out choices that are stated in the question, you should also strike out any answers that contradict the information given in the passage. Something that goes against what the passage says cannot be logically inferred from the passage. If you&amp;#39;re asked to think about something outside the passage, consider whether the logic is the same in both cases. If something in the passage is said to work or succeed, we can reasonably assume that a very similar application or use of it would work or succeed in a different setting. If the question turns on an argument, rather than on a practical application, you can still think in these terms. Could you take this argument and apply it elsewhere? To answer this, you&amp;#39;ll need to think about how the argument itself works. What is the author advocating? What does she shoot down? Why is she making the claims she makes?The questions we&amp;#39;ve just introduced are the ones that are hardest to get the hang of. They take time, and they take a considerable amount of thought. Our best advice for preparation is practice, practice, practice. And our best advice for the exam setting, is leave these until last, if you can. Before you get to these types of questions, tackle the other types of questions, the last two of which we&amp;#39;ll discuss now….The fourth general type of question in the reading comprehension section deals with the author&amp;#39;s own attitude toward the subject matter. As with the inference questions, this type of question requires that you understand some of the subtleties of the text. Questions in this category may look like this: ·&nbsp; &nbsp; The author&amp;#39;s own attitude toward this topic can best be described as... ·&nbsp; &nbsp; The tone of this passage is... ·&nbsp; &nbsp; The author discusses this topic in order to.... and so forth.The author of the passage we&amp;#39;ve been considering makes herself virtually invisible. We have no sense of what she thinks about Archer&amp;#39;s ideas or about the problem of endangered species in Australia. The most we can say about her is that she is neutral. Imagine, however, that the following paragraph followed what we have already read: Archer&amp;#39;s indifference to the fate of cats and other imported species thriving in Australia reflects a disturbing inconsistency in his philosophy. He champions the right to life of one species while wantonly condemning another to extermination. Lest we think he favors Australian animals to the detriment of others, we need take note that he is not so catholic in his selection. Archer has advocated the harvesting of kangaroo meat for human consumption. He argues that, unlike cows or sheep, kangaroos have had millions of years of evolutionary experience grazing the land without causing damage to the surface of Australia. Moreover, kangaroos are tastier - to his palate - than either beef or mutton. Archer&amp;#39;s willingness to sacrifice the kangaroo points to a fundamental hypocrisy in his position. He is no great lover of animals, even those native to his homeland. Let&amp;#39;s look at a tone/attitude/opinion question that might accompany the passage with its new addition...The author&amp;#39;s attitude toward Archer&amp;#39;s proposal can best be described as:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;censorious<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;skeptical<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;condemning<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pessimistic<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dismissive<br />
The best answer here is (C) condemning. To say that she was censorious - which means extremely critical - would be too strong. And yet she lets herself be engaged, and even annoyed by Archer, which means that dismissive is not quite right. She&amp;#39;s more than skeptical about his task, and pessimism is the wrong genre of word to use to describe a reasoned stance on a scientific subject. Condemning it is.</td></tr></table>

<h2>reading tactics(续)</h2>

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td class="t_f" id="postmessage_43842">
Okay. Four question types down, one to go. You&amp;#39;re almost there. The last type of question is the most straightforward type, and the one that - if you&amp;#39;re pressed for time - you might be able to answer without reading the whole passage. <br />
This genre of question may ask you to look for stylistic devices in the passage. Examples of such things include anecdotes, rhetorical questions, similes, metaphors, generalizations, and hyperboles. Or the question might ask you to determine the meaning of a word based on the context. <br />
Be cautious here. Sometimes a familiar word might be used in an unfamiliar way. Always consider the information surrounding the specific word. A definition from context question may be phrased in a number of ways: <br />
·&nbsp; &nbsp; The author uses the phrase X to mean which of the following... <br />
·&nbsp; &nbsp; The word X as it appears in line Y most nearly means... <br />
·&nbsp; &nbsp; The term X in line Y most likely refers to.... <br />
Let&amp;#39;s have a look at an example.<br />
Here again is the relevant part of our passage: <br />
Dissatisfied with traditional efforts at conservation, biologist Michael Archer, director of the Australian Museum in Sydney, has begun to champion a new method for ensuring the perpetuation of Australia&amp;#39;s endangered species. Archer advocates domesticating native animals such as the quoll, the hopping mouse, the wallaby, the sugar glider and the brushtail phascogale. <br />
After such a passage, you might conceivably find the following question: <br />
A sugar glider is most likely: <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sweet Australian snackfood.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poisonous snake.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small arboreal possum.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rare marsupial the size of a cow.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A model plane.<br />
Likely you have no more clue about what a sugar glider is than we did before we researched this topic. But you can probably figure it out from context. Let&amp;#39;s go through each of the answers. <br />
Dissatisfied with traditional efforts at conservation, biologist Michael Archer, director of the Australian Museum in Sydney, has begun to champion a new method for ensuring the perpetuation of Australia&amp;#39;s endangered species. Archer advocates domesticating native animals such as the quoll, the hopping mouse, the wallaby, the sugar glider and the brushtail phascogale. <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sweet Australian snackfood. <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&amp;#39;t be misled by the word sugar here. Remember that you found the word amid a list of native animals that can be domesticated.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poisonous snake.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer is closer than (a), because it&amp;#39;s at least an animal. But does a poisonous snake sound like it would make an ideal pet? Hardly. A poisonous snake is unlikely to feature in an argument outlining perfect pets. <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small arboreal possum. <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite possibly. You don&amp;#39;t even need to know what arboreal means, and you&amp;#39;re only slightly ahead of the game if you would recognize a possum. The fact that we&amp;#39;ve hit on a small animal keeps this answer in the running. Once you look through the other possible answers, and find yourself eliminating those, you&amp;#39;ll come back to this one certain that it&amp;#39;s right.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rare marsupial the size of a cow. <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer starts off well. We know we&amp;#39;re looking for a rare animal, and, it being Australia, there&amp;#39;s a reasonable chance it will be a marsupial. But what about the size of a cow? We&amp;#39;ll have to rule this answer out. Archer is specifically discussing animals that make good housepets. No matter what Great Dane lovers might say, few things the size of a cow fall into this category.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A model plane. <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember to watch for context. If you didn&amp;#39;t have any other information, you might reasonably guess that a sugar glider was a type of plane. However, we know from context that we&amp;#39;re dealing with an animal here, not a motorless jet. Strike it out.<br />
A few final thoughts on this last category of question: <br />
As we&amp;#39;ve said elsewhere, if you&amp;#39;re running out of time, it may help you to first answer questions that point to specific words or phrases. You won&amp;#39;t have to read the whole passage to get at them, so they&amp;#39;ll take less time. <br />
This doesn&amp;#39;t mean skipping the reading altogether, though. Remember that with vocabulary from context questions, it is essential that you pay attention to the context surrounding the word or words you&amp;#39;re being asked about. Be aware that a familiar word may very well be used in an unfamiliar way. <br />
It&amp;#39;s not enough to see the word and say &amp;quot;I know what that means.&amp;quot; Ultimately you need to be able to say &amp;quot;I know what that means HERE.&amp;quot;<br />
Tips <br />
 <br />
Now that we&amp;#39;ve introduced the general types of question you&amp;#39;ll encounter, and explored the flow of a specific passage, let&amp;#39;s talk about some of the ways you can approach a passage, and some specific strategies that can help you get through the reading comprehension section. <br />
Click to the next page to start the tips...<br />
If it helps, we&amp;#39;re happy to admit that we feel the same way that you probably do about the reading comprehension questions. They&amp;#39;re long, and they take a lot of time, and sometimes they&amp;#39;re really boring. And even when they&amp;#39;re interesting, they still demand a lot of energy and focus. <br />
Because they do take time, we encourage you to answer the other types of verbal question first. <br />
Every correct answer on the test is worth the same as every other correct answer. Why not go after the questions that are less hard-earned first? Answer the sentence completions - the questions you can do quickly - first. Then head for the reading comprehension section.<br />
Of course, having just said that you should leave reading comprehension questions to last, we should also say that about half the SAT verbal questions are reading related. You cannot do well and not do reading. <br />
Consequently, it is very important to leave time for the reading passages. There&amp;#39;s no point reading the passage at a speed that only allows you to understand half of it.<br />
There are ways you can improve your reading comprehension. The most obvious of these is simply to read, read, read. <br />
Do you read every day? Is what you read the right kind of reading to get you in gear for the SAT? The back of the cereal box doesn&amp;#39;t count; an article in the New York Times does. <br />
The more you read, the better - and faster - you&amp;#39;ll get at it. <br />
Let&amp;#39;s emphasize again the importance of reading actively. This is a matter of training yourself to synthesize and integrate what you&amp;#39;re reading. <br />
As with everything else, there are strategies that can help your reading. We&amp;#39;ve outlined a few of them on the coming screens.<br />
The major question about the reading comprehension section is what to do first. <br />
Should you read the questions, or just jump into the text? <br />
All we can say about this is: it&amp;#39;s up to you. It&amp;#39;s entirely a matter of personal ease and comfort. <br />
We&amp;#39;ve had students who much prefer to glance through the questions first; others who go straight at the passage. <br />
If you are going to read the questions first - just skim them. A minute or two tops should give you a feel for the types of things you&amp;#39;ll be looking for. Then start in on the passage.<br />
When you get to the reading passage, always read the italicized portion at the top. <br />
This will orient you to the text. The italicized bit will not only tip you off as to what the text is about - you would hopefully have gathered this from the first few sentences anyway - it will also let you know where it came from. <br />
If the introduction said: <br />
The following piece comes from an advice column on teenage dating... <br />
You would not only know that the passage will treat dating, but also that it is written by someone who is trying to pass along advice. <br />
Now you would take a very different approach to the text if the introduction said: <br />
This is a satirical piece about teenage dating <br />
or <br />
This is a from an advice column written 80 years ago on teenage dating.<br />
As you read, pay close attention to the beginning and ending sentences of each paragraph. These will give you clues as to the main ideas expressed in the passage, and will give you a sense of how the logic of the passage flows. <br />
Also keep your W&amp;#39;s in mind: <br />
Who (or what) is this passage treating? What&amp;#39;s the dominant theme? <br />
What problem is presented in the passage? What solutions are given for it? <br />
Where do we see specific examples of the problem? What kind of details does the author offer to illustrate her point? <br />
Why is the author making this point?<br />
It&amp;#39;s important that you stay with the text. <br />
It&amp;#39;s your job to find it interesting - at least for 12 or 15 minutes. All too often students zone out, and complain that the passage wasn&amp;#39;t fun. <br />
The harsh bottom line on this is: Tough. Stay focussed. <br />
The test will be over faster than you know - you&amp;#39;ll have all afternoon and the rest of the weekend to let your mind wander over more interesting topics.<br />
After you get through the passage, you&amp;#39;re unfortunately still only partway there. Now you need to tackle the answers. <br />
It might help you to have a general sense of how the questions work. One way you can get this understanding is to go through this tutorial, and to work at practice questions. <br />
Another helpful trick you can do is to practice making up your own reading comprehension questions. Find yourself a passage - you can use one of ours, or even do the exercise with something you&amp;#39;ve read on your own - and think of some questions that ask about the main idea, specifics, tone, vocabulary, or inferences. <br />
You might find that this is a good exercise to do with a friend or study partner: you can bounce questions - and answers - off each other. <br />
Pretty soon you&amp;#39;ll get a feel for how the questions themselves work.<br />
In the test, when faced with the question, beware of distractors among the answers. <br />
By distractors we mean answers that are true about life, but not true about the text. <br />
Suppose you read a text about pollution and one of the answer choices says &amp;quot;global warming has recently become a concern.&amp;quot; While this may be true, you need to be sure that the text says it. And even if it does say it, does this choice answer the question? <br />
This is one of the most common ways our students get these questions wrong. They read the answer and say &amp;quot;Oh, that&amp;#39;s true.&amp;quot; They forget that they have to think in the text.<br />
Be aware of the fact that in the reading passage questions you are often confronted with many answers that seem right. <br />
We can think of some examples from the real SAT where we can fight amongst ourselves for hours about which is the right one. The really controversial questions happen but they are rare. On these, if you were given a pen and paper, you could probably write a convincing essay defending any answer as the right one. <br />
But remember this is a multiple choice test - they&amp;#39;re looking for the most obvious answer. Sometimes this means you&amp;#39;ll have to rein in an urge to read too deeply, and go instead with the most straightforward interpretation. <br />
The vast majority of the time there is an answer that is better than the others for a very good reason.<br />
Finally, if in the test, you do find yourself pressed for time, you can try to do the line number questions. These are the ones that say &amp;quot;In line 14, what does phascogale mean&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;In paragraph five, what does the author mean by overkill?&amp;quot; These are speedier because they tell you exactly where in the text to find the relevant information, and often all they&amp;#39;re asking you about is a phrase or even a single word.<br />
Summary&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
We know that we&amp;#39;ve just laden you with a lot of information, and we know that you might be overwhelmed. Yes, your work is cut out for you. But the good thing is that practice can get you quite far with these questions. It&amp;#39;s not a matter of having an aptitude for reading or not; the more you read, and the more questions you answer, the better at it you&amp;#39;ll become. Good luck - and don&amp;#39;t get discouraged!</td></tr></table>
