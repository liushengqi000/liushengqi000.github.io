Shortly after the title of this talk was announced, I received some threats <br />
on my life. I have therefore decided to change the subject of this talk from<br />
 Pea Soup, Tripe and mathematics to Trip, Pea Soup and Mathematics. In more <br />
conventional language I wish to discuss the mechanical, meaningless mathemat<br />
ics that is still being taught in 90% of the colleges and universities, the <br />
mathematics that many professors would like to substitute for this establish<br />
ed material, and finally what I believe mathematics is and therefore should <br />
be taught. My concern today is primarily with the freshman courses but many <br />
of the remarks apply to the entire undergraduate curriculum.<br />
Let us look for a moment at the status of mathematics education. I believe t<br />
hat I do not have to convince anyone here that we are failing to put mathema<br />
tics across. One only has to note the reactions of students to the subject, <br />
for example, their grim countenances in class, to see that we are failing. O<br />
ne can check this conclusion by asking his colleagues in other departments -<br />
 surely an intelligent group - how they feel about the mathematics they took<br />
 at school.<br />
<br />
In trying to locate the source of the trouble, one first recognizes that stu<br />
dents, teachers, curricula, and texts all enter the picture. The trouble may<br />
 lie in any one of these quarters. Well, there can be some criticism of the <br />
students. But since about 95% of the students feel that they get nothing fro<br />
m their study of mathematics, the trouble can hardly be there. Criticism can<br />
 be made of many teachers but since the most knowledgeable of the professors<br />
 have the same trouble, this factor too can&amp;#39;t be more than a part of the dif<br />
ficulty. We come therefore to curricula and texts and these may be discussed<br />
 together because the texts reflect the curricula, at least these days when <br />
almost anyone can get a text published.<br />
<br />
I proceed therefore to examine the standard curriculum college curriculum fo<br />
r freshmen, algebra, and trigonometry. Let me consider first whether the mat<br />
erial we teach is knowledge in any significant sense. Does it give us any un<br />
derstanding of the physical world? Does it teach us anything about human phy<br />
siology or social institutions? Does it help us to get along with our fellow<br />
 man? Does it teach young people how to choose their mates or even the food <br />
they should eat every day? You may regard these questions as ridiculous but <br />
what I am getting at is that Horner&amp;#39;s method, trigonometric identities, and <br />
partial fractions seem to have no bearing at all on the knowledge and proble<br />
ms with which even educated men should be concerned. This material has no re<br />
lationship at all to human affairs in the broadest sense. In and for itself,<br />
 it is meaningless material.<br />
<br />
Of course we could be teaching something which has little or no bearing on h<br />
uman affairs and yet possesses intrinsic interest and beauty. The subject of<br />
 ceramics might be an example. Well, I believe that I can honestly say that <br />
I like mathematics. But I hate manipulation of fractions. The laws of expone<br />
nts fail to thrill me. The quadratic formala, the supposed shining light of <br />
algebra, is a huge disappointment. Partial fractions are insufferably dull. <br />
The ambiguous case is not ambiguous to me; it is decidedly disagreeable. Tri<br />
angle identities keep me amused for a short time until the thought crosses m<br />
y mind that I ought not to waste time and better do something significant. T<br />
here is beauty in mathematics but there is no topic and no proof in college <br />
algebra or trigonometry which posses it. These subjects are dry as dust; the<br />
y are mathematics at its worst.<br />
<br />
Because students are uninformed and a captive audience, they can be gotten t<br />
o absorb rubbish. But even rubbish has to be motivated. The topics we teach <br />
in college algebra and trigonometry not only are not motivated but cannot be<br />
 motivated because in and for themselves they serve no purpose. We can tell <br />
students that they will use this material if they continue with mathematics.<br />
. But who would want to continue with mathematics after such an introduction<br />
 to it? You know the answer as well as I do. Very few. The students who reje<br />
ct mathematics after being exposed to algebra and trigonometry are wiser tha<br />
n the teachers.<br />
<br />
I repeat that from algebra, geometry and trigonometry as such nothing follow<br />
s for the students. My thought here was best expressed by Alfred North White<br />
head in an address made many years ago to a group of British teachers of mat<br />
hematics.<br />
<br />
....elementary mathematics... must be purged of every element which can only<br />
 be justified by reference to a more prolonged course of study. There can be<br />
 nothing more destructive of true education than to spend long hours in the <br />
acquirement of ideas and methods which lead nowhere. ...there is a widely-sp<br />
read sense of boredom with the very idea of learning. I attribute this to th<br />
e fact that they (the students) have been taught too many things merely in t<br />
he air, things which have no coherence with any train of thought such as wou<br />
ld naturally occur to anyone, however intellectual, who has his being in thi<br />
s modern world, ... the elements of mathematics should be treated as a set o<br />
f fundamental ideas, the importance of which the student can immediately app<br />
reciate: that every proposition and method which cannot pass this test, howe<br />
ver important for a more advanced study, should be ruthlessly cut out...<br />
Over and above these objections to the standard material there is another, t<br />
he topics are disconnected. From the manipulation of fractions we shift to e<br />
xponents, from exponents to factoring, from factoring and perhaps the soluti<br />
on of equations, to complex numbers, from complex numbers to mathematical in<br />
duction, from induction to permutations and combinations, from these to prog<br />
ressions, to binomial theorem, to partial fractions, etc. Even the trigonome<br />
try material has only an apparent coherence. What has triangle solving to do<br />
 with identities, identities with trigonometric equations, the equations wit<br />
h trigonometric functions, the functions with the polar form of complex numb<br />
ers.? Surely sin theta and cos theta are involved in all of these trigonomet<br />
ric topics but this underlying thread is a trivial one and a technical one. <br />
From the standpoint of motivating students and large ideas there is no unity<br />
 in trigonometry. How can this welter of unrelated or superficially related <br />
topics taught in college algebra and trigonometry produce more than confusio<br />
n in the minds of the students.<br />
<br />
What I have been trying to point out thus far is that the material we have b<br />
een teaching to almost all of the freshman course of the past 100 years is m<br />
eaningless, unmotivated, ugly and disconnected. We have taught processes whi<br />
ch 95% of the students will never use, and even those who do go on to use it<br />
 will not be effective because the material is taught mechanically. Starting<br />
 with fractions in the elementary school the students learn to perform like <br />
martinets. As the students attempt to master process after process, the mean<br />
inglessness of the material frustrates them. As the years go by, the pile of<br />
 meaningless operation becomes too large to bear; the entire structure colla<br />
pses; and the students&amp;#39; progress is hopelessly blocked. Because the material<br />
 has been meaningless to them, they forget readily and willingly.<br />
I can sharpen the distinction between what we have been teaching and mathema<br />
tics. The Greeks, you know, distinguished between arithmetic, the science of<br />
 number, and logistica, the practice of commercial arithmetic. An analogous <br />
distinction should be made today. There is mathematics, the science and art,<br />
 and there is mathematics, the craft or trade. Trade mathematics is to mathe<br />
matics as plumbing is to hydrodynamics and as electrical wiring is to electr<br />
omagnetic theory. We have been teaching the trade and neglecting the science<br />
 and art. We have been teaching the tripe and neglecting the nourishing meat<br />
<br />
Unfortunately many teachers do not understand the distinction between mathem<br />
atics as a trade and mathematics as an art. They themselves learned the trad<br />
e as an apprentice to some journeyman and hence they know only the trade. Th<br />
ey are the victims of a curriculum now over 100 years old and their understa<br />
nding is limited to manipulative mathematics. They are entrapped by walls an<br />
d tradition, educational; practices, and systems and the walls are so high t<br />
hey can&amp;#39;t see over them. After their indoctrination into the union of mathem<br />
atical craftsmen these teachers grow old and die. Perhaps they have heard th<br />
at mathematics is a gift of the Greeks and therefore fear it - in fact fear <br />
it more than their students. At any rate they never venture into mathematics<br />
 proper.<br />
<br />
The &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; books, endless repetitions of algebra and trigonometry, which appe<br />
ar by the dozens each year cater to these teachers and fail to challenge the<br />
ir narrow horizon. Ultimately, the texts become masters of the teachers and <br />
these men follow the books slavishly. Though I do not wish to-day to digress<br />
 into the subject of mathematical texts, when I think of them, I am reminded<br />
 of a remark which William Gilbert, the famous seventeenth century scientist<br />
 makes in his De Magnete. After pointing out that Cardan in his writings des<br />
cribed a perpetual motion machine and that many other writers did likewise, <br />
he exclaims, &amp;quot;May the gods damn all such shame, pilfered, distorted works, w<br />
hich do not but muddle the minds of the students!&amp;quot; May I add, and the teachers.<br />
<br />
Up to this point, I suspect that I still have a few friends and sympathizers<br />
 in the audience because fortunately, a small but interesting group of mathe<br />
matics teachers has become convinced that the conventional curriculum is bad<br />
 and is trying to do something about it. But I am afraid I shall lose these <br />
friends within a few minutes.<br />
<br />
The group of people I have in mind who wish to reform the freshman curriculu<br />
m have this much in their favour. They do not want to teach ideas; they do w<br />
ish to exhibit and practice the reasoning processes of mathematics; and they<br />
 are ready, willing, and able to break with the tradition of techniques for <br />
the sake of techniques. But I fear they have gone to the opposite extreme, f<br />
or their recommendation is that we teach modern abstract mathematics. And so<br />
 we find in some of the newer texts such topics as symbolic logic and Boolea<br />
n algebra, postulational systems, set theory, rigorous establishment of the <br />
real numbers as Dedekind cuts, and of the complex numbers, as couples, abstr<br />
act algebra, e.g., groups and fields, functions as transformations from one <br />
domain to another, and the like.<br />
<br />
Here indeed we do find ideas and clean cut proofs. There are just a few diff<br />
iculties. This material is completely over the heads of the students. It is <br />
as meaningless to them as the mechanical techniques.<br />
<br />
The students are not prepared for such material. How can anyone understand t<br />
he rigorous establishment of the real number system who can&amp;#39;t add fractions <br />
or distinguish rational from irrational numbers? How can anyone appreciate s<br />
ymbolic logic who confuses all A is B with all B is A? Of what significance <br />
is Boolean algebra to students who can&amp;#39;t square (a+b) or believe that the sq<br />
uare root of (a2+b2) is equal to a+b? What can an abstract postulational sys<br />
tems mean to students who have yet to understand deductive proof?<br />
Advocates of the new material say that students will learn these things thro<br />
ugh the abstract approach. But the concrete, indeed, a thorough understandin<br />
g of the concrete, must come before the abstract. This is the first principl<br />
e of the psychology of learning. A collection of formulae such as (p&amp;gt;q).(q&amp;gt;r<br />
)&amp;gt;p&amp;gt;r will not teach deductive reasoning. Examples of groups such as finite <br />
groups with multiplication tables will not make the concept of a real number<br />
 any clearer. Students who have learned the field concept and some of its th<br />
eorems will not necessarily be able to add 6 and -7 or to add fractions. Why<br />
 with a perfect knowledge of the field concept these students couldn&amp;#39;t make <br />
change in a grocery store. They would be tied helplessly and hopelessly to a<br />
 lot of, to them, meaningless assertions. Abstraction is not the first stage<br />
 but the last stage of development. It may give new insight but only into co<br />
ncrete subject matter already learned. It may unify but it must unify what o<br />
ne already knows.<br />
<br />
Whether or not the students can absorb these abstract topics I would object <br />
to them on the additional ground that abstract mathematics is empty mathemat<br />
ics - it is pea soup as opposed to steak. It is the form without the substan<br />
ce, the shell without the kernel. One does not get something for nothing eve<br />
n in mathematics. Certainly the concept of a field includes the rational, re<br />
al and complex numbers and these distinctions are all important for any unde<br />
rstanding of elementary mathematics.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I can make my point clearer by suggesting that we look at the corres<br />
ponding problem in geometry. Why don&amp;#39;t we abandon triangles, circles, rectan<br />
gles, parabolas, etc. and just study the concept of a geometrical figure? Ha<br />
h, say the abstractionists, now you are talking my language. let&amp;#39;s teach top<br />
ology. Yes, but topology will not teach us how to obtain the area of a rectangle.<br />
<br />
The claim has been made that the abstract approach is more efficient because<br />
 several topics of conventional mathematics are encompassed in one approach.<br />
 But the claim is illusory. The concrete cases must still be taught. The tim<br />
e that is wasted is the time spent in teaching the abstract concepts, for wh<br />
en the concrete cases are understood, the abstractions are readily made.<br />
Implicit in the preceding arguments is another objection to the abstract rig<br />
orous topics listed above. This knowledge is useless knowledge, something we<br />
 can&amp;#39;t afford in today&amp;#39;s world. The student who learns all about postulation<br />
al systems will not be prepared to make the simplest use of mathematics. he <br />
will be at a loss in solving even a linear equation. We cannot afford the cr<br />
iticism that will be levelled at such training by the physicists, chemists, <br />
engineers, and the industrial world.<br />
<br />
Finally, even if the students learned the abstract mathematics and its inter<br />
pretations, I would still object because this material is not representative<br />
 of mathematics. One indispensable element has been omitted - the physical w<br />
orld. Mathematics is above all an idealized formulation of physical objects <br />
and phenomena and mathematics is significant and vital because it has someth<br />
ing to say about the physical world.<br />
<br />
The abstractionists apparently want to keep their subject pure. They don&amp;#39;t w<br />
ish to sully it or they desire to remove the dross of the earth from which m<br />
athematics has arisen. But as they wash the ore, they keep the iron and lose<br />
 the gold. No man is an island unto himself and no subject can exist in isol<br />
ation. A perfect command of the English language is useless if a man has not<br />
hing to say. And pure mathematics has nothing to say. I may appropriate here<br />
 Russell&amp;#39;s famous dictum: Pure mathematics is the subject in which we never <br />
know what we are talking about nor whether what we are saying is true. And i<br />
f we don&amp;#39;t know what we are talking about the students surely won&amp;#39;t.<br />
Some may say that of course the physical world is there. One has to interpre<br />
t the mathematics. Perhaps so. The modern abstract painters tell us that the<br />
 physical world, people, and emotions are all in their works. But I defy you<br />
 to find them.<br />
<br />
Before turning to some more positive remarks I would like to make one more r<br />
emark about the movement to teach rigorous abstract mathematics. This subjec<br />
t matter is being advertised as modern mathematics. Literally the advertisem<br />
ent is truthful. The concept of a field is more modern than the concept of f<br />
unctions. But like all advertisements, it is sales talk. It is a come-one. I<br />
t is propaganda. The word modern is intended to connote something better tha<br />
n the old, indeed surpassing it so much that it should replace the old. But <br />
should this be done in mathematics? Real numbers, equations, functions, coor<br />
dinate geometry are still not only good but vital mathematics. They have not<br />
 been superseded. Fields have not replaced real numbers in science or engine<br />
ering. Mathematics is not an automobile in which the 1955 chrome trimmings a<br />
t least are better than the trimmings of a 1900 model; nor is mathematics a <br />
scientific theory such as a theory of light which is superseded by a new theory.<br />
<br />
Of course emphasis and methods do change in mathematics. Much of the triangl<br />
e solving usually taught in trigonometry no longer warrants the emphasis giv<br />
en to it and the methods of the Greek geometers by the method of coordinate <br />
geometry. But this is another matter to beginning with abstract formulations<br />
 of the very concepts and methods you do want to teach. Let us not be misled<br />
 by the word modern.</td></tr></table>

I have criticised, perhaps too seriously, what teachers have been doing. It <br />
is time to say what I recommend and urge. The direction in which I have been<br />
 heading is no doubt already evident.<br />
<br />
What should we teach? We want material that will provide motivation, sustain<br />
 the interest of the student, exhibit the methods of the operation peculiar <br />
to mathematics, and demonstrate the chief values of mathematics. I believe t<br />
hat the answer is to tie mathematics closely to the study of the physical wo<br />
rld. I do not mean that mathematics should be buried in some corner of a phy<br />
sical science course but rather that we should motivate interpret, and apply<br />
 mathematics through fundamental physical problems and of course include whe<br />
rever possible the broader implications, largely cultural, of what mathemati<br />
cs has accomplished. Mathematics derives from the study of nature and is val<br />
uable mainly because of what it returns to nature.<br />
<br />
I will not undertake to provide here a full defence of this thesis but would<br />
 like to give a few indications. My defence rests on history, almost always <br />
a sound guide. The beginnings of mathematics in Egypt and Babylonia were cer<br />
tainly physical and practical though limited in scope. The Greeks studies ma<br />
thematics because it provided them with an understanding of the workings of <br />
nature. Indeed mathematics was regarded as the essence of nature and perhaps<br />
 too closely identified with nature. When the study of nature was neglected <br />
during the Middle Ages, mathematics was neglected and when the study of natu<br />
re was revived in the Renaissance, mathematics was revived. The seventeenth <br />
century was a period of extraordinary activity in both mathematics and scien<br />
ce. The great lights of mathematics were also the great lights of science. A<br />
nd throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the major advances in<br />
 mathematics were indissolvably linked with major advances in science.. It i<br />
s true that the creation of non-Euclidean geometry produced as a consequence<br />
 the first sharp cleavage between mathematics and science and showed that ma<br />
thematical investigations even seemingly totally unrelated to the study of t<br />
he physical world may be enormously significant, but the major lesson to be <br />
derived from the history of non-Euclidean geometry is that purely mathematic<br />
al and abstract studies are valuable because they may prove to be useful in <br />
the understanding and mastery of the physical world. Of course at this stage<br />
 the danger also arose that mathematicians would abuse the freedom which the<br />
 creation of non-Euclidean geometry granted to them and go on to create wild<br />
 and valueless systems of thought. I shall return to this point shortly.<br />
It could of course be the case that progress in mathematics was concomitant <br />
with progress in the sciences but that the mathematicians themselves worked <br />
independently. But this is not true. The great Greek mathematicians, the Ion<br />
ians, the Pythagoreans, the Platonists, Eudoxus all sought to understand nat<br />
ure. Archimides scientific interests and inventions are famous and in fact t<br />
hose who are familiar with his little treatise, the Method, know that he tho<br />
ught physically even to discover mathematical theorems. The physical interes<br />
ts of Fermet, Descartes, Newton, and Leibniz are well known. May I just give<br />
 the key words, optics, mechanics and astronomy. The same is true for Legend<br />
re, Lagrange and Laplace. Euler in the eighteenth century worked in almost e<br />
very branch of mathematical physics, optics, hydrodynamics, analytical mecha<br />
nics, lunar motions for navigating, calculus of variations, acoustic, wave m<br />
otion generally. The name of Gauss immediately recalls astronomy, geodesy, e<br />
lectromagnetism, cartography, inventions, &amp;quot;Mathematics, Queen of the Science<br />
s&amp;quot; is, of course, his phrase, as is the statement &amp;quot;Mathematics is the scienc<br />
e of vision&amp;quot;. Poincare and celestial mechanics are inseparable. None of thes<br />
e men would have appreciated or respected the distinction being made today b<br />
etween pure and applied mathematics.<br />
<br />
Indeed it is fortunate that these masters did think intuitively and physical<br />
ly. Had the Greeks not identified geometry and physical space, they would ne<br />
ver have developed geometry for even Euclid&amp;#39;s presentation, the so-called ri<br />
gorous version, relies upon physical facts which he failed to list as assump<br />
tions. Newton and Leibniz were fumblers as mathematicians; their logic was c<br />
onfused. But they had physical insight and so proceeded to make invaluable c<br />
ontributions. Indeed the whole history of the calculus is a comedy of errors<br />
 whilst most fruitful ideas were being developed and applied. From the stand<br />
point of rigor, Euler made the crudest mistakes but he founded the calculus <br />
of variations. That mathematics has derived its inspiration, specific proble<br />
ms, meaning, and goals from the physical science is no accident. I should ma<br />
ke it clear that this appeal to history is not an argument for keeping the l<br />
ogic of mathematics in a confused state but it does show how much mathematic<br />
al thought is dependent upon physical problems.<br />
<br />
Of course my sketch of the forces which have produced mathematics is one-sid<br />
ed and incomplete. Mathematicians did create branches of mathematics which w<br />
ere not applied until centuries after their creation. Yes, but those men had<br />
 already acquired a love for mathematics and moreover were already keenly aw<br />
are of the significance of their subject. Those who created in the dark, so <br />
to speak, wasted their time as, I fear, many mathematicians are wasting time<br />
 in abstract fields today. In any case we should not be teaching to freshmen<br />
, mathematics which may some day lead the way to new applications.<br />
It is also true that many mathematical investigations though perhaps origina<br />
lly suggested by scientific problems extended far beyond the needs of scienc<br />
e, e.g. Galois theory. And other investigations such as the theory of number<br />
s have received almost no stimulus from science. These investigations are va<br />
luable, insofar as they are aesthetically attractive. But I would not try to<br />
 sell the beauty of mathematics to freshmen. They must first overcome a dist<br />
aste for the subject and acquire at least a modicum of comprehension.<br />
I have thus far recommended teaching mathematics that can be related to phys<br />
ical problems and using the scientific aspect to give motivation and meaning<br />
. What about rigorous, deductive proof? This is a goal but not the approach.<br />
 We do indeed want the students to appreciate the power of reasoning to prod<br />
uce new knowledge and we should continually emphasize this point whenever we<br />
 have proved something significant by deduction. But there are several cauti<br />
ons. First we must prove something significant to the student. To prove that<br />
 the multiplication of irrationals is commutative on the basis of a Dedekind<br />
 cut definition of irrationals, is not significant to students who are still<br />
 struggling with the very concept of the square root of 2. Nor will the proo<br />
f that the order of a subgroup in a finite group divides the order of the gr<br />
oup, mean anything to students who do not see what point there is to the ver<br />
y concept of a group.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the capacity to appreciate mathematical rigor is a function of the<br />
 age of the student and is independent of the age of mathematics. Some of th<br />
e recent books on calculus which have stressed rigor (Begle and Menger) are <br />
the heights of absurdity for this reason.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, rigorous proof is the polish on mathematics. It is the last stage o<br />
f a development. The very concept of deductive proof in itself is the produc<br />
t of only one civilization of hundreds, the civilization of the Greeks. This<br />
 fact in itself shows that rigorous proof is a sophisticated, difficult, and<br />
 even esoteric concept. Hence it is certainly not easy for the students. Mor<br />
eover, the rigorous proof comes after the discovery and full intuitive under<br />
standing of the theorem to be proved. This is true historically of mathemati<br />
cs in the large and is true of the very process of creating individual theor<br />
ems. Today we are trying to emphasize the gilt and the polish and we are lea<br />
ving out the substance. We are throwing away the heritage of mathematics.<br />
To illustrate how these general recommendations may be put into practice let<br />
 me give just one example of how one might treat a subject commonly taught i<br />
n elementary mathematics and which must be taught if the students is ever to<br />
 do anything at all with mathematics, namely, coordinate geometry. This subj<br />
ect is treated about as shabbily as any I know of. The tendency today is eit<br />
her to shorten the material to the bare mathematical essentials of the old t<br />
echnical presentations or to give some highly sophisticated concept of funct<br />
ion and then apply it to curves.<br />
<br />
What is the major idea we wish to put across? It is that we can write an equ<br />
ation for a curve which not only fully represents the curve but that we can <br />
then study the properties of curves systematically and very effectively with<br />
 the full powers of algebra and analysis.<br />
<br />
To motivate the interest in curves one must give a few examples of the occur<br />
rences of these curves in genuine physical problems. e.g. the conic sections<br />
 in reflectors, lenses, planetary motion, and projectile motions. Let&amp;#39;s pose<br />
 genuine problems e.g. to design the cable of a bridge, when will the moon e<br />
clipse the earth (simplified)?, where will a projectile land? Let&amp;#39;s not just<br />
 suppose students appreciate the need to solve those problems but discuss th<br />
em at the very beginning.<br />
<br />
Then let us pose the problem of how we can derive facts about these curves. <br />
We know their geometric definitions but these do not seem to provide any ans<br />
wers. It should be clear to the students before proceeding that we need meth<br />
od. I would then discuss the Euclidean methods and show how clumsy and speci<br />
alized they are. Let us illustrate this for the circle, e.g. we might prove <br />
of the circle involving chords and tangents. I would then digress from the m<br />
athematics proper to present Descartes&amp;#39; interest in method from mathematics,<br />
 science, and philosophy. This discussion could even enter into some problem<br />
s of philosophy, then extend perhaps dependant upon the interests of the gro<br />
up. With a liberal arts group the subject should be pursued further than wit<br />
h a group of mathematics majors.<br />
<br />
We could then teach coordinates and equations of curves in the usual way and<br />
 do some geometrical problems by the methods of coordinate geometry, prefera<br />
bly the same problems previously used to illustrate the clumsiness of Euclid<br />
ean geometry. Incidentally we should teach the algebra we need as we need it<br />
 and thereby take care of some of the topics in the usual college algebra course.<br />
<br />
As we teach the various topics let&amp;#39;s do several things. First let us make ge<br />
nuine applications of each idea. Secondly, the teacher and text should inclu<br />
de some physical explanations which will make the applications intelligible <br />
and real to the student. Thirdly, the applications should not be a series of<br />
 disconnected problems. They must be organized to make a coherent body of pr<br />
oblems. A few classes of applications thoroughly treated will do more than a<br />
 thousand unrelated ones.<br />
<br />
For example, some coordinate geometry texts do mention the focusing property<br />
 of a parabola. But nothing is said about light rays and so the students fee<br />
l uneasy about the entire application. One should certainly point out that r<br />
ays are an approximate method for treating light and radio waves and point o<br />
ut that the law of reflection for rays is a physical law which very fortunat<br />
ely fits in with the purely geometric property of the parabola, namely, that<br />
 the radius vector to a point on the parabola and a line parallel to the axi<br />
s and through that point make equal angles with the normal. Many application<br />
s of curve and equation to light should be described. If these physical and <br />
mathematical ideas are fully discussed the students will enjoy the applicati<br />
on, see the role of mathematics, and willingly undertake further problems on<br />
 the same idea.<br />
<br />
As another example, when teaching parametric equations we should teach proje<br />
ctile motion. Again the surrounding physical facts must be taught. The possi<br />
bility of using parametric equations for physical applications rests on phys<br />
ical fact that the horizontal and vertical motions of a projectile are indep<br />
endent of each other. Also, the mathematics should be used to predict facts <br />
about the motion, e.g. range, maximum height. At this point the power of mathematical reasoning can readily be stressed.<br />
<br />
After the students have gotten some part of the usual coordinate geometry ma<br />
terial behind them, it is time to boost their interest by introducing some n<br />
ew ideas. The possibility of investigating higher dimensions and even a brie<br />
f start on this subject will pique them and keep them curious and anxious for more mathematics.<br />
<br />
Somewhere in the course one should point out that new curves can be discover<br />
ed by means of equations. This is now done in routine problems which presupp<br />
ose the curve exists. Let&amp;#39;s make this topic an exploration into new territor<br />
y. It is new for the students. Here we have the opportunity to do something <br />
exciting.<br />
<br />
And somewhere near the end of the course one must point out and stress the m<br />
ost important value of coordinate geometry for modern times. Coordinate geom<br />
etry is the basis of applied mathematics. The students have already seen how<br />
 reflector shapes, paths of projectiles and planets have been represented by<br />
 equations and then studied. But coordinate geometry makes is possible to ta<br />
ke any path and shape and study it mathematically. Let&amp;#39;s talk about the hull<br />
s of ships, the fusilages and wings of aeroplanes, the paths of radio waves <br />
in space, the shapes of bridge cable and roadways and point out that we can <br />
now study all of these physical shapes by efficient mathematical methods. Le<br />
t&amp;#39;s refer to the calculus yet to come as a powerful new tool which works on <br />
the equations of these curves and surfaces.<br />
<br />
The treatment I have recommended for coordinate geometry should be applied t<br />
o every undergraduate mathematical subject right through differential equati<br />
ons. I might remark incidentally that I envisage wiping out college algebra <br />
as a subject in and for itself.<br />
<br />
May I summarize the point of view toward mathematics which I believe is prop<br />
er for elementary instruction. Math is an abstract formulation of ideas sugg<br />
ested by the physical world; it is the artful use of reasoning processes to <br />
infer and deduce new facts about the physical world; it is a series of signi<br />
ficant assertions about the physical world; and it contains implications abo<br />
ut almost all the arts and sciences. All four aspects of mathematics must be<br />
 taught. Techniques are boring but necessary details which must be properly <br />
subordinated to the ideas, the reasoning and the conclusions. Moreover they <br />
should be taught when needed for some larger goal.<br />
<br />
I know that as I suggest treatments of the various branches of elementary ma<br />
thematics which will bring out these values of mathematics many of you are m<br />
entally protesting, where do we get all this material. Well, I have given so<br />
me samples of the scientific relationships and cultural influences in my boo<br />
k Mathematics in Western Culture. With the little work I did along these lin<br />
es I could have written a book twice the size. Unfortunately my commitments <br />
do not permit me to devote much time to gathering and organizing such materi<br />
al but I am certain that it exists in abundance. It must be collected and pu<br />
t into the curricula and textbooks of the future.<br />
<br />
Here then is the direction in which we must go to improve the mathematics cu<br />
rriculum and here is the road for textbook writers to pursue. Let me echo Gi<br />
lbert again, &amp;#39;May the gods damn all the sham, pilfered distorted works which<br />
 have but muddled the minds of the students&amp;#39; and here I add, may the gods bl<br />
ess those undertakings which seek to enrich the teaching of mathematics.<br />
