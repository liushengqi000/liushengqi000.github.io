Hogwarts<br />
I thought I was finished with college visits and CC reviews for a while, but I was wrong. Like most of our juniors, S has been receiving the usual recruitment cards for U.S. colleges. After our return from the states, I noticed a thick, heavy envelope addressed to him, but without a return address, and 揂n Invitation to Hogwarts?in fancy script on the outside. I also didn抰 see a stamp or anything. I asked my darling W about it. She said it had been slipped the mail slot while we were gone. S later opened it and inside the envelope was an invitation to an overnight visit to Hogwarts School (What a name! I figured there must be an interesting story behind it). The invitation didn抰 provide much information. It said HW was instituting a new program to attract prospective students. It also claimed to be the most outstanding school of its type in the world. Unfortunately, the claim didn抰 mean too much since it didn抰 identify the 搕ype?of schools represented. It included some travel information about London, and S likes London! Attending school in the UK has always interested S, and he really wanted to visit HW. It抯 the most enthusiasm he抎 shown for any school prior to a visit. I抎 mostly recovered from the Grand Am Boogie tour. I thought, 揥hy not? Let抯 go!?<br />
<br />
The invitation had some rather odd instructions to access the website, but it worked. The website still didn抰 tell me much about the school, although there was a picture, one of those video types. A very dramatic looking place, almost like a castle, and kinda gloomy. Of course in the UK, it could be a castle. The only link was to travel arrangements, with two options: train or car. I thought about driving, but the car link was their version of a joke. The only option was a 揚egasus?which was described as a 搈id-sized flying car?that could automatically activate and navigate. It was a strange joke, but funny. I love the British sense of humor. It was like an old Monty Python routine because you were also supposed to pay in some foreign currency called Galleons and Sickles. Anyway, I opted for the train, which was free and was called 揟he Hogwarts Express.?Since we have ridden the 揝tansted Express?to London from the Stansted airport, that sounded legit. The lack of information in the invitation bothered me, especially since there was no address or information about COA at HW. The uncertainty worried me, but we like visiting the UK, the train wasn抰 going to cost anything, and it sounded like an adventure. If it turned out to be a hoax, I figured we could go to a show in the West End and visit the British Museum again while we were in London. <br />
<br />
The directions on the website told us to go to King抯 Cross train station and wait between platforms 9 and 10. A conductor would meet us there. Our trip to that point was uneventful and sure enough, the conductor seemed to appear out of nowhere and led us to the train. It was an old fashioned, bright red locomotive pulling a few cars. The train was great and I figured no one would go this far to perpetuate a hoax. We climbed aboard for the trip. <br />
<br />
We arrived in the afternoon, and we were met at the HW train station by the visit coordinator. He was a giant of a man named Hagrid. My S said this school must be like Earlham where they only use first names. We later found out they are more formal than that. Hagrid looked a little like I picture Curmudgeon, but without cowboy boots. He appeared to be wearing furs. That抯 not very PC in the U.S., but maybe it抯 not a big deal in the UK. Then it suddenly occurred to me that this might be an extremely conservative school, or even an old-fashioned fundamentalist religious school. I hoped we weren抰 about to visit the UK version of Bob Jones U! Thankfully, my fears were unfounded. <br />
<br />
HW looked like an ancient castle, but I think it had been designed as a school from the beginning. To some extent, it reminded me of some of the buildings at Kenyon, but on a larger scale. Looking around, it appeared to be even more isolated than Gambier though. The building sits up on a hill with a lake below. The countryside looked rather wild and untamed. I think we were in Scotland, but they never told us. To get to the main building, they had a 揾orseless?carriage! It was our first introduction to something that is fascinating about HW. They are a High Tech school, but they incorporate the technology into the old traditions. It抯 almost like they抮e High-Tech Luddites! The carriage must have been battery powered and on a preprogrammed track since I didn抰 see a driver. It was quiet, efficient, high tech, and yet quaint! HW was getting more interesting. <br />
<br />
We were met by Professor McGonagall. She looked a bit like the actress Maggie Smith, but she had an elusive feline quality. When I tried to make some joke about the 揾orseless carriages?she gave me a look that could curdle milk. She can probably be a real witch when she wants to be, and I抣l bet there抯 no misbehavior in her class! Oh yeah, Prof McGonagall is the AC, teacher, and the head of a house. (more on the houses later) It appears that many of the faculty and staff have multiple roles. I guess that抯 not too unusual for a small school. For example, in addition to being the visit coordinator, Hagrid teaches an endangered species class and he has other duties as well. I抦 unsure about the faculty-student ratio but it must not be great with so many people wearing more than one hat. <br />
<br />
Prof McGonagall said we were scheduled to meet with Professor Dumbledore for an interview. She briskly escorted us through the halls and used a voice activated security lock to access a hidden door. I thought that level of security was extreme, but then I was distracted by a very clever spiral escalator that led to his office. I don抰 know what their endowment is, but it must be huge! <br />
<br />
Professor Dumbledore was apparently the school president, but they call him Headmaster. You抳e got to love a school that calls its president 揌eadmaster.?He looked like an ancient hippie with robes and a flowing beard but he was very sharp and astute. Despite his appearance, I had the impression that he was a real wiz as an administrator. His whole office was filled with weird high tech gizmos. He also had a beautiful bird like none I抎 ever seen before. We had an unusual and interesting interview, with Professor Dumbledore asking my S a lot about his childhood. For some reason, I couldn抰 think of any questions to ask. When my S told him he didn抰 know if he had the right stats and background to be accepted to HW, Dumbledore told him not to worry and, 揑t抯 our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.?I liked that thought and I anticipate that HW has an essay related to the topic of choices in the application paperwork. He gave me his card, but I don抰 know where I抳e put it. It seems to keep 揹isappearing.?LOL! <br />
<br />
After the interview, we spent some time wandering around the building and the campus. While we were outside, several students approached us to talk. They were friendly and helpful, but they seemed concerned that we should not wander too close to the forest or the lake. Another security issue? It concerned me that the students seemed somewhat tense and fearful on their own campus! I asked them if it was finals week, but they said it was months before their tests. Who knows, maybe they just thought I抎 fall in the lake! I was trying to get a closer look at an interesting willow tree when a student took my arm, told me it was time for supper, and escorted us inside. He may have been an off-duty tour guide. <br />
<br />
Inside the building, the technology HW kept amazing me. For example, their flat screen technology was incredible. They had the screens everywhere disguised as paintings. All of the screens were playing different programs, although they didn抰 look too interesting most of the time. (In Prof D抯 office he had screens with shows of guys sleeping. I thought British TV had improved in the past 30 years.) I have to say it was hard to find your way around the building. It had a rather confusing layout and unusual escalators and stairways. My initial impression was that HW was a very high tech school, primarily for engineers specializing in visual effects. (For example, the 3-D holo 揼host?projections were seemed almost real). But Latin was being used extensively in snatches of lectures I overheard as we walked by. Maybe they study the classics as well. And I don抰 think they would offer a class on endangered species in an engineering school, or put it out in the middle of nowhere. <br />

Posts: 103&nbsp;&nbsp;The eating hall is just like you抎 expect from old English films. Large tables, high ceiling, stone walls. The ceiling was fascinating. At first I thought it was painted to look like the sky, but then I realized it was changing. The projectors are hidden very cleverly because I couldn抰 spot them. I抦 telling you, CalTech and Disneyland don抰 have anything on this place! (I抣l bet a bunch of their funding comes from LucasFilm.) The food was very good, and there were many choices. It seemed like you only had to express a desire, and you抎 find it on your table. They don抰 have many teachers, but they must have a huge support staff. HW was the only place we抳e visited that you didn抰 have to pick up your own food or clean up your table after eating. I always thought the labor costs are high in the UK. Maybe it抯 less in Scotland. <br />
<br />
We learned a great deal from the students during supper, much more than from the faculty. The first thing I learned was a new term for Americans. I know the British often call Americans 揧anks?but there seems to be a new term: 揗uggles.?Yanks I understand, but Muggles? They also didn抰 seem to apply it to my S, only me. Maybe a muggle is a 揗iddle-aged Yank? Given a choice, I抎 choose 揧ank?but they seemed to use it in a derogatory manner. Nice kids (mostly).<br />
<br />
The robes worn by the students and faculty were really cool. The students all wore black, but the faculty also wore robes, sometimes in wild and garish colors. The faculty ate at the head table, and they seemed to come from a variety of backgrounds. Many of them certainly didn抰 dress conservatively. I didn抰 get a feel for the political persuasion of the school, but conservative/liberal doesn抰 mean the same thing in the UK anyway. There was an odd tradition that I must mention. Everyone, faculty and students, carry little sticks with them. They didn抰 explain the significance of the sticks, but they seemed to be important to them. It must be a British thing. <br />
<br />
The 揌ouses?are their versions of dorms combined with frats. The students remain in the same house all the years they attend HW. The houses are coed, although I don抰 know how they抮e divided, or whether they have shared bathrooms. Competition between the houses is fierce. This aspect of HW reminded me of Notre Dame, although ND doesn抰 have coed dorms. There抯 no rush and no rejections from houses. Apparently students are selected randomly for placement in their houses by drawing names from a hat. The students were from all over the UK, and there was a really blending of students from different backgrounds, cultures, and races. However, the students self-segregated according to their four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. <br />
<br />
Most of the students in Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff, looked like regular students, and they seemed to mix a bit with each other. However, Slytherin students isolated themselves and they appeared to be the 揋oth?house. They were pale, wore a lot of black and seemed arrogant, but much more so than Vandy. I actually thought I saw a Slytherin student sneer at us as we walked by! We抳e come across very little anti-American sentiment overseas, but maybe he was French. (Just joking, we haven抰 had any problems in France either.) Their Head teacher, Professor Snape, was a really intense looking guy. I抣l bet his classes are interesting though. He apparently teaches chemistry. While I抦 talking about the faculty again, I抣l add that there seems that there is a lot of nepotism in the school hiring practices. Apparently, all of the admin and faculty graduated from HW. To remain viable, it seems to me that they should seek out 揻resh blood?from some other schools, rather than always hiring from within. <br />
<br />
Intramural sports are big there; especially something they called 換uidditch.?It sounds like it must be a Scottish game played with brooms and balls. I suppose it might be like curling. Maybe a Scottish variation, because I think curling was originally Scandinavian in origin. The students seemed excited about it but it didn抰 sound too interesting to me. I guess when you抮e that isolated, you抣l settle for any kind of activity. Now that I抦 thinking about the isolation, I wonder if they have alcohol-related problems. Also, my cell phone wouldn抰 work because there were no cell towers nearby. Like I said, this place is really isolated. <br />
<br />
After supper, a bunch of the Gryffindor students left with S for their dorm. He was spending the night with them. I liked the students, but only caught a couple of names, Ron and Hermyonee (I抦 not sure about the spelling for her name, but an English girl I think. I liked her accent.) I didn抰 see him for the rest of the night. I never could figure out where the dorm rooms were. It was almost like they were hidden. I don抰 know if that was another security precaution, or a custom that has some historical significance. <br />
<br />
After my S left, Professor McGonagall recommended an after-dinner cordial. She said it was a HW tradition for visiting parents. The drink was very pleasant and I soon retired to my room. I was out when my head hit the pillow that night. It was almost like I抎 taken a sleeping potion! The bed was small, but comfortable. I had some really odd dreams, but I awoke the next morning feeling rested. <br />
<br />
I returned to the eating hall for breakfast. The food was again plentiful, varied, and delicious. My S joined me and he said he抎 had a fantastic night with his new friends in the dorm! It sounded like he抎 spent the whole night talking with them. And miracle of miracles, he wanted to talk with his mother and me about something important when we got back. Wow, he wants to talk!<br />
<br />
We took the train back, but I slept the whole way. Another college visit nap I guess. We definitely enjoyed our visit, especially my S. He seems inspired and has an energy about him that I抳e never seen before. I have to admit that HW was an amazing place and it would be a very interesting school to attend. The great age of the place, the robes, even the quirky 搒tick carrying?tradition, made it fascinating, especially for an American student. However, I抦 concerned about why HW finds it necessary to implement so many security measures. Most of the students seem excited, happy, and engaged in learning. Yet, it抯 the only school we抳e visited where I had the feeling there is an underlying tension, as if some kind of 搕hreat?hangs over HW even when its not finals week. I wonder whether HW might be in financial trouble and they don抰 want to scare away prospective students by 搉aming?the trouble out loud. <br />
<br />
Despite my misgivings (and I know this sounds crazy), Hogwarts had an almost 搈agical?feel to it, as if there was something wondrous about to happen. My S has definitely moved it up to #1 on his list and says it抯 his 揇ream School.?He doesn抰 want to apply anywhere else, and he even has a list of school supplies we have to purchase at some 揺xclusive?shopping district in London. (As if we couldn抰 find the stuff at our Base Exchange, or online if necessary.) London is expensive!<br />
<br />
I know I抳e been somewhat negative, and Hogwarts may have its faults, but the school has inspired my son!!! I抦 extremely happy about that. I also know he shouldn抰 put all of his eggs in one basket. They said only very special and talented students are admitted to Hogwarts. I抳e always believed that describes both my children. But 揹ream school?or not, I know we need some safety and match schools, since Hogwarts appears to be a reach school. I also don抰 know if we can afford Hogwarts. Wow! I just realized I never asked them about COA or financial aid while I was there. How could I forget that? Carolyn, do you know anything about them? Does the College Board site include UK schools? I抎 like to tell everyone on CC more about it but this is too long already. Also, I must be tired because my memory seems to be fading. Oh, here抯 my DW and DS. We finally have time to talk!</td></tr></table>
